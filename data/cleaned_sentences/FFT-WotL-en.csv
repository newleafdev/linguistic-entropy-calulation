"A year following the defeat of the Fifty Years' War, the King had died from a terminal illness earlier and the prince who was to succeed him was only two years of age."
This meant his guardian would reign in his stead as King.
"The Queen's elder brother, Duke Larg, was designated as guardian, but fearing the Queen's oppressive reign, the parliament ousted the potential prince and appointed instead the King's cousin, Duke Goltanna, as guardian and regent."
Both Dukes Larg and Goltanna were equally proven generals during the Fifty Years' War.
"Though Goltanna rallied support from the powerful Nobles, disenfranchised Nobles and knights clearly rallied around Larg."
Goltanna fought under the crest of the Black Lion while Larg fought under the crest of the White Lion.
"This is the beginning of the upheaval which would later be known as ""The War of the Lions"".(https://imgur.com/gallery/t5QZwwx) (https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Wiki)2.PROLOGUE ""I am Arazlam, student of Ivalice's Middle Age."
"You are familiar with the War of the Lions, no?"
It was a bitter war of succession that rent the land of Ivalice in two.
"Here we first find mention of Delita Heiral, a hithertofore unknown young man, the hero who would draw the curtain of this dark act of our history."
His is a heroism of great renown - a story familiar to all who dwell within our land.
"Ah, but what the eye sees is oftentimes a mere fragment of the truth."
"There was another young man, the youngest of House Beoulve, long famed for producing leaders of knights and men."
There is no official record of the role he played on history's stage.
"However, according to the Durai Papers, the existence of which became known to the public only this last year - they had long lain concealed in Church archives - this forgotten young man is in fact the true hero."
"The Church maintains he was a heretic, an inciter of unrest and disturber of the peace."
Which accounts is to be believed?
"Join me in my search to uncover the answer.""3.EXT."
FIELDS OF GALLIONE - DAY A richly beautiful landscape of grassy knolls and rivers.
A young knight kneels against the edge of a creek bed.
This is DELITA HEIRAL.
He dons golden-red armor and a white cape with the emblem of a black lion.
He mounts his chocobo and signals for other chocobo-mounted knights to follow.
Together they dash from the woods.
"They cross an open field, traverse the remains of an ancient stone ruin, then race towards their target- A centuries old monastery remotely situated along a river embankment."
A dark storm looms over the building.
INT.
ORBONNE MONASTERY - DAY PRINCESS OVELIA prays alone at an altar while a female knight and an elder man in holy robes look after her.
"OVELIA O Father, abandon not Your wayward children of Ivalice, but deliver us from our sins, that we might know salvation."
"FEMALE KNIGHT Lady Ovelia, it is time."
"OVELIA still kneeling( ) I'll not be much longer, Agrias."
"AGRIAS Your escort has already arrived, Majesty."
"ELDER steps forward( ) Please, heed the good lady's words, Highness."
You must hurry.
"Three mercenary swordsmen enter the front doors.4.MERCENARY LEADER Still in here, are you?"
It's been the better part of an hour!
"AGRIAS Gaffgarion, you forget yourself, ser!"
You are in the presence of the princess!
The two swordsmen behind GAFFGARION kneel instantly.
"But he remains standing, head-bowed."
GAFFGARION Mayhap bowed heads would less offend.
You would do well to waste less time on idle pleasantries.
AGRIAS I see even the noble Order of the Northern Sky cannot rid itself of vulgar knaves.
GAFFGARION raises his head( ) A guard captain in these rain-sodden hinterlands ought not expect chivalry.
"We are in the employ of the Order, not of it."
Our pay does not cover trite courtesies to the likes of you.
AGRIAS Guard your tongue!
OVELIA stands() Enough.
Let us be on our way.
The two swordsmen behind Gaffgarion arise.
Ovelia addresses the robed man.
"ELDER The Father watch over you, child."
"OVELIA And you, Elder."
LIGHTNING FLASHES the screen as an injured female knight enters.
She limps towards the princess.
The Elder rushes to her aid.5.FEMALE GUARD Milady!
The enemy is upon us!
ELDER Duke Goltanna's men?
Agrias rushes outside without hesitation.
Gaffgarion appraises his men.
GAFFGARION We are paid for this.
Time to earn our keep.
"What is it, Ramza?"
You above getting paid to do a job?
RAMZA I'm a knight no longer.
Just another sellsword.
GAFFGARION Right then.
To battle!
The three swordsmen follow Agrias outside.
"OVELIA Deliver us, O Lord..."
EXT.
ORBONNE MONASTERY - DAY Agrias and her two female Lionsguard knights stand before a host of enemies bearing a black lion's crest.
It is raining heavily.
Harsh winds and loud thunder.
AGRIAS They bear the crest of the Black Lion...Duke Goltanna must be mad!
Does he mean to start a war?
"ENEMY KNIGHT You there, wench!"
You cannot hope to defeat us!
You will surrender the princess!
"If not...Well, I would hate to see anything happen to that pretty face of yours."
"Gaffgarion, Ramza and LADD join the battle."
GAFFGARION A head-on assault.
"These swords of Goltanna...lackwits one and all.6.AGRIAS In that case, we should be able to handle this without you, Gaffgarion."
"GAFFGARION Mayhap you could, but there's no money to be made in that!"
Ladd!
Ramza!
With me!
The battle begins.
Rain pours harder.
GAFFGARION (cont'd) Kill them all!
Leave no man standing!
AGRIAS You would have us slaughter them?
Are you mad?
Kill them here and you'll have played into Duke Goltanna's hands!
We need only put them to rout!
GAFFGARION I find dead men rout more easily.
The party slays every enemy to the man.
Lightning flashes over the monastery's rain-soaked roof.
A SCREAM is heard from inside.
OVELIA Unhand me!
AGRIAS The princess!
INT.
"ORBONNE MONASTERY - DAY Ovelia struggles with an armored assailant, Delita."
DELITA This way.
Be quick!
And try making a little less noise.
OVELIA I'll not take orders from you!
"DELITA You've quite a mouth on you, Princess."
"Delita strikes Ovelia, knocking her unconscious."
She falls into him.7.DELITA(cont'd) Forgive me.
"'Tis your birth and faith that wrong you, not I."
Agrias bursts into the church with Ramza at her tail.
They spot Delita just as he leaves through a back door.
AGRIAS Hold there!
Damn!
Delita escapes as Agrias attempts to cut the kidnapper off.
"But Ramza remains still, captivated at the sight of the person kidnapping the princess."
RAMZA Is it truly him?
EXT.
"ORBONNE MONASTERY - DAY Ramza sprints out of the church for the back, looking frantically on as he barely catches a glimpse of Delita."
The two men acknowledge each other as Delita carries Ovelia with him on a chocobo mount.
"Delita escapes, leaving Ramza shocked; and Agrias gives up her chase."
AGRIAS catches her breath( ) It cannot be...
RAMZA Delita.
He lives?
But why does he fight under the banner of Duke Goltanna?
"Rain continues to fall as the two look on, helpless."
END OF PROLOGUE8.CHAPTER I - THE MEAGER (One year earlier...) INT.
"MAGICK CITY OF GARILAND, KNIGHTS APPRENTICE ROYAL MILITARY AKADEMY - DAY Ramza and his friend Delita are young cadets training at the Gariland Akademy to become Knights."
"Arazlam narrates: ""Records of the hero Delita first appear one year before the outbreak of the War of the Lions."
"The loss of the Fifty Years' War saw knights returning from the front stripped of livelihood, their fealty to the Crown and nobility abandoned."
"Many became rogues and traitors, men donning the thief's cloak and plotting treason against the Crown."
It was a time of great unrest for Ivalice - murder and theft were commonplace.
Many were the young adventurer and mage who stepped forward to counter this threat.
"Of such, the city of Gariland, too, saw its share..."" KNIGHT APPRENTICE #1 Another wain was struck last night on its way to Eagrose."
KNIGHT APPRENTICE #2 The Corpse Brigade again?
RAMZA I wonder where all this leads...
"Delita, what do you make of this?"
DELITA I'm not sure.
"I have my guesses, but..."
RAMZA I'm listening.
DELITA I think Duke Larg is coming to Gariland.
RAMZA Duke Larg?
Why?9.DELITA Not just the duke.
"The marquis Elmdore de Limberry, too."
RAMZA That's the first I've heard of it.
This has not the sound of a state visit.
DELITA All of Ivalice is in turmoil.
"The Order's supposed to be keeping things under control, but the fact is, they number too few."
RAMZA And they mean to bolster their numbers with us?
The apprentices file in as a Knight enters the room.
He takes position on a wooden dais at the head of the gallery.
"KNIGHT All right, everybody, form up!"
The Order of the Northern Sky has an assignment for its knights apprentice.
"As I'm sure you're already aware, the number of brigands roaming Gallione is on the rise."
"Among them, the Corpse Brigade...a seditious lot with a grudge against the Crown."
Rogues such as they must be dealt with.
The Order has been commanded to undertake an operation to eliminate the Brigade - an operation of a grand scale.
We will not be acting alone.
"The Order will be joined by, among others, His Excellency Duke Larg's royal guard, stationed at Eagrose."
This will leave Eagrose Castle undermanned.
"Your task will be to proceed there, and support us from the rear by bolstering its defenses."
"A female knight walks in, whispers something briefly to the Knight, then leaves in a rush."
"KNIGHT(cont'd) The time to take up arms is upon you, young apprentices!"
"(MORE)10.I've just received word that a bandKNIGHT(cont'd) of thieves routed by our knights flees here to Gariland, seeking refuge."
"We will move to stop them, and finish the task of our brothers."
"You, young apprentices, will accompany us."
This is but a squall before the storm of battle.
Prepare yourselves at once!
Dismissed!
Apprentices file out the gallery as they prepare to head into their first battle.
EXT.
STREETS OF GARILAND - DAY Knight apprentices stand off against a band of thieves and rogues.
Ramza and Delita lead the charge.
"ROGUE What have we here...Wee moppets, is it?"
Our luck's went and turned for the better!
"Aw'right, lads!"
Cut through these ones and we're good as fled!
We'll make quick work of them!
"And don't be leaving no squealers behind, neither!"
The rogue and his band advance on the apprentices.
"DELITA Careful, Ramza!"
Remember: The well- aimed thrust pierces the mail.
"RAMZA Don't patronize me, Delita!"
We Beoulves know our way around a battlefield.
"ROGUE Beoulve, was it?"
"Heir to the noble House Beoulve, I'd wager."
Looks like we have ourselves some apprentices from the Akademy!
"Well, highborn moppets is still moppets!"
RAMZA Lay down your arms or die clutching them!
"None will mourn your passing.11.ROGUE And you mean to make us do that, then?"
You're in far over your little heads!
The battle ends and the thieves are stopped.
"Ramza sheathes his blade, looking somewhat callow shaking his head over their dead bodies."
"RAMZA Honest work would see them die old in bed, yet they choose instead this early grave."
Why persist in such folly?
INT.
BEOULVE MANSE - DAY In the waning days of the Fifty Years' War...
"Arazlam narrates: ""Barbaneth Beoulve, a great hero in his own right who had attained the distinguished title of Knight Gallant, approaches the hour of his death."" ZALBAAG, DYCEDARG, and ALMA BEOULVE surround BARBANETH'S bed."
Barbaneth is ailing and his death seems eminent.
BARBANETH What news of...of the war?
ZALBAAG The Order has struck a great blow.
Limberry is ours once more.
We will be able to recall our forces in Zeltennia anon.
"All goes as planned, Lord Father."
Be not troubled.
DYCEDARG The envoy dispatched to Advocate Lenarrio has returned.
"He has agreed to your proposal, Lord Father."
"BARBANETH Good, very...good."
Then the war will die with me.
Alma is in tears.
"ALMA Father...12.BARBANETH There now, Alma."
Do you want my...my last memory to be of your tears?
ZALBAAG Where is that Ramza?
He should be here at your side!
"BARBANETH Dycedarg, Zalbaag."
You are dear to me.
But Ramza is no less so.
"Though he be not the issue of the womb that bore you, my sons, still my blood courses his veins."
Watch after him.
Loud footsteps are heard.
Ramza bursts into the room.
RAMZA Lord Father!
"DYCEDARG You forget yourself, Ramza."
BARBANETH You have come.
Good.
Let me...let me look once more on your face.
RAMZA Lord Father...
BARBANETH How long has it been?
You've grown into a...a fine young man.
I would hear of your studies.
"You've been at the Akademy since...since spring, is it?"
Ramza grabs his father's hand.
"BARBANETH (cont'd) Hear me, Ramza."
"For generations, we Beoulves have stood foremost of those who serve the Crown."
Ours is the soul of the knight.
Become a knight worthy of your name.
Tolerate no injustice.
Stray not from the true path.
You will know the path you must walk.
A Beoulve can...can walk no other...
"RAMZA I will not fail you, Father.13.BARBANETH Your friend, Delita."
He is a good boy.
"He is lowborn, but he can serve you well."
I've made arrangements for him to enter the Akademy.
chuckles( ) You should have seen the look on the headmaster's face.
In the years ahead you will need someone whom you can trust.
You could do far worse than Delita.
"RAMZA As...as you say, Father."
BARBANETH Take care of your sister.
with his last breath( ) And show these brothers of yours what it is...what it is to be a knight...
EXT.
MANDALIA PLAINS - DAY Delita and Ramza chance upon a young squire taken hostage by a few highway brigands.
HIGHWAY BRIGAND #1 Looks like this one's still alive.
What do we do with him?
HIGHWAY BRIGAND #2 What do you think we do with him?
"HIGHWAY BRIGAND #1 Right, then."
"Your luck's run out, knave, if ever you had any."
"Ramza and Delita approach, weapons drawn."
HIGHWAY BRIGAND #2 Blast!
One of the Order's patrols.
DELITA The Corpse Brigade...And they've a hostage in their midst.
RAMZA Our first duty is to destroy the Brigade.
The enemy stands before us - attack!14.DELITA You would stand by and watch as they kill an innocent?
RAMZA I hadn't planned on giving them the chance.
Had you?
"DELITA somewhat surprised( ) I would save him myself, if it came to that."
"The young squire, ARGATH, seizes the chance to free himself."
ARGATH Reinforcements...and none too soon.
The three young men defeat the brigands.
RAMZA Are you harmed?
ARGATH I'll be fine.
It is for the marquis's safety I fear.
RAMZA The marquis?
The marquis Elmdore de Limberry was here?
ARGATH The very same.
And to whom do I owe my gratitude?
RAMZA We are knights apprentice from the Akademy at Gariland.
We may be able to help you.
But first I would hear more.
Post-battle.
The three introduce one other.
"ARGATH My name Argath, a knight in His Excellency the marquis Elmdore de Limberry's household."
"DELITA A knight, you say?15.ARGATH Well, truth be told, I am a knight apprentice...as are you, if I'm not far mistaken."
"RAMZA A fellow knight-in-training, then."
"I am Ramza Beoulve, and this is Delita Heiral, my trusted friend."
Argath's face immediately lights up.
ARGATH Beoulve?
"You're not of the Beoulves of the Order of the Northern Sky, are you?"
What fantastic luck!
A blessing in the midst of disaster!
RAMZA What-?
ARGATH takes Ramza's hand( ) The Order can help me rescue the marquis!
It must!
DELITA The marquis is held captive?
"ARGATH They took him hostage, yes, but he still lives!"
We must act quickly if he is to remain so.
"Should he be killed, I will lose everything..."
"Again, he takes Ramza'a hand, pleading with him."
ARGATH(cont'd) You simply must help me!
Please!
I beg you!
DELITA Calm yourself.
"Who's to say your marquis is to be killed, anyway?"
The Corpse Brigade would not take a man alive save there were value in keeping him so.
Of that you can be sure.
"RAMZA There's little the three of us can do to help, in any case."
"(MORE)16.If the marquis was taken hostage,RAMZA(cont'd) Eagrose will be in an uproar."
"You can be sure of that, too."
DELITA Then before all else we will report in to Eagrose.
Are we agreed?
ARGATH Agreed.
We'll start there.
INT.
"EAGROSE CASTLE, SOLAR - DAY Upon arrival at Eagrose, Ramza, Delita and Argath have a meeting with Ramza's eldest brother, Lord Dycedarg."
"DYCEDARG I hear you were decorated for your first victory, Ramza."
They sing your praise from on high.
"You do honor to our name, my brother - and to me."
RAMZA I am glad.
DYCEDARG Oh?
You would not seem it.
RAMZA I am - forgive me.
Your words do me far more honor than I have done you.
"No doubt word has already reached you, but the marquis de Limberry's carriage was waylaid, and the marquis taken."
What have you a mind to do?
DYCEDARG I have already asked Zalbaag to dispatch a squad in pursuit.
"These brigands must eventually come forth to demand ransom - that is, assuming the marquis yet lives."
Argath sharply rises to attention.
"ARGATH I beg of you, Lord Beoulve!"
Lend me a hundred men that I might hunt the whoresons down!
"Dycedarg is obliquely silent.17.ARGATH(cont'd) Please, my lord - grant me means to avenge my fallen friends!"
DYCEDARG Mayhap your ears fail you.
I said that a squad is to be dispatched.
You are not a man of Gallione.
Leave her affairs to those of us who are.
ARGATH B-but...my lord!
DYCEDARG Do not assume to beg favors of me!
"Let me remind you, Argath, lest you forget your place."
"You are but another sword, not yet even knighted."
"Argath takes his seat again, deflated."
"DYCEDARG (cont'd) The two of you will remain here at Eagrose, and serve among the castle guard."
You needn't worry.
Danger is not like to visit these walls.
EXT.
"EAGROSE CASTLE, GARDENS - DAY Ramza, Argath and Delita walk amidst manicured roses."
"Argath stops along a bridge, and regales in lamentation."
"ARGATH My own house was once respected as highly as House Beoulve, you know."
"At least, until my grandfather was captured during the war."
"He turned traitor, thinking to buy his freedom with the lives of his friends."
But his freedom scarce outlived his honor.
He was not a dozen paces out their gate when the dagger found his back.
"Killed by some common squire, no more a knight than I."
One of the men he betrayed later escaped and spread word of his misdeeds.
"My lord father would have none of it, of course."
But he was the only one.
"Our bannermen deserted us, our reputation ruined.18.He bends down and picks up a small stone, tossing it into the water."
ARGATH(cont'd) I suppose I had best remember my place.
Your lord brother has no reason to lend ear to please from the likes of me.
"A comely peasant girl calls from afar, waving."
TIETRA Delita!
DELITA Tietra!
RAMZA Alma!
Zalbaag!
"Alma, Zalbaag and Delita's sister, TIETRA, stand not too far away, making their way towards the three."
"ALMA Ramza, you've come home!"
"RAMZA It's been some time, hasn't it, Zalbaag?"
ZALBAAG I heard about Gariland.
They say you made short work of those brigands.
Now you're truly the right to call yourself a Beoulve.
Father would be proud.
"RAMZA Thank you, Lord Brother."
ZALBAAG Ha!
You certainly haven't changed.
Gods forbid you show a bit of cheer on being praised!
"And you, Delita!"
Do not think word of your deeds escapes our ears.
Your sister's been so full of pride I quite feared she might burst!
"Everyone turns to Tietra.19.TIETRA Worry not, my seams have held."
"I'm glad to see you looking so well, Delita."
DELITA And I you.
Have you settled in at school?
"TIETRA Yes, the others have all been quite kind to me."
"ZALBAAG Would that we could speak at greater leisure, but there are duties that require my attendance."
Rogues do not catch themselves.
RAMZA I understand.
Good luck.
Zalbaag turns to leave and waves.
He barely takes a few steps before speaking back to Ramza.
ZALBAAG We received a note of ransom from the Corpse Brigade.
ARGATH What!?
ZALBAAG Something about it sits unwell with me.
"They are anarchists to be sure, bent on bringing down the aristocracy."
"But they fancy themselves righteous, and prey only on the nobility and those in our employ."
Would such as they truly kidnap the marquis for want of coin?
ARGATH Why wouldn't they?
They're naught but common footpads!
ZALBAAG One of the men I planted among them has not returned.
"I worry he may be caught up in something serious, but there are those who do not think some mere spy worth a search party's efforts.20.RAMZA Where was he last known to be?"
ZALBAAG A merchant city named Dorter in eastern Gallione.
Guarding a castle grows dreadfully dull...Wouldn't you agree?
Zalbaag departs.
Argath also prepares to leave by another exit.
Ramza and Delita say their farewells to their sisters.
"DELITA Forgive us, Tietra."
It seems we must be leaving sooner than we had planned.
TIETRA Don't worry about me - just take care of yourself.
DELITA embraces her( ) I will.
Mind your studies!
I'll be back before you've even noticed I'm gone.
Delita leaves with Argath.
Tietra sees him out.
DELITA(cont'd) Let's be on our way.
Ramza and Alma are alone.
"ALMA Tietra puts on a brave face, but the truth is not as honeyed as her words."
RAMZA What do you mean?
ALMA She has a hard time of it at school.
The others tease her for being lowborn.
Ramza is unsure how to respond.
"ALMA(cont'd) Forgive me, I shouldn't have said anything."
I'm sure you have worries enough of your own.
(MORE)21.Tietra will be all right.
I'm here toALMA(cont'd) look after her.
RAMZA Then there is naught to worry about.
But mind your own limits.
You can't be responsible for everything.
ALMA Says the brother who never fails to do any and all that is expected of him.
"Don't lose sight of yourself, Ramza."
You needn't let your life be ruled by the fact you were born a Beoulve.
RAMZA Now you're starting to sound like Mother.
Ha ha ha!
"He leaves, and Alma is left ruminating."
A sharp wind blows.
ALMA Ramza...
EXT.
"MERCHANT CITY OF DORTER, SLUMS - DAY In a back alley corridor, two men stand face-to-face in the empty streets."
One appears a knight donning a white cape.
SWORDSMAN I said I know naught of it!
"He tries to flee, but the White Knight stops him."
WHITE KNIGHT Do not speak false to me!
I know what you've done!
Where is Gustav?
"I will have it from you, one way or another!"
SWORDSMAN I-I don't know.
WHITE KNIGHT What of the marquis?
Where have you hidden him?
Tell me!
He grabs the swordsman by the collar and tosses him down a ways.
The knight draws his blade and aims it at the swordsman's throat.22.WHITE KNIGHT (cont'd) I will not ask again.
Where are they?
SWORDSMAN The desert!
Th-they're in the desert!
WHITE KNIGHT ...The Sand Rat's Sietch.
RAMZA (O.S.) from afar( ) Hold!
WHITE KNIGHT turns() The Order's swords.
My luck turns foul with the weather.
The Knight flees as Ramza and his companions arrive.
ARGATH It seems we did well to come here.
DELITA Have I not seen that man before?
"RAMZA You know him, Delita?"
"DELITA I have seen his face, I'm sure of it."
"It was at Eagrose, just after the war's end..."
The Swordsman stands and has summoned allies to his side.
"RAMZA You'll pardon me my misgivings, but this has not the look of any joyous reunion."
To arms!
They begin to battle.
DELITA I've just remembered!
That man - his name is Wiegraf!
He commanded the Dead Men during the war - a company of volunteers assembled from the peasantry.
ARGATH What?
But that would make him-23.DELITA Aye.
The commander of the Corpse Brigade.
The battle ends.
And the three take a member of the Corpse Brigade prisoner.
INT.
"MERCHANT CITY OF DORTER, SHED - DAY Ramza, Delita and Argath interrogate a Corpse Brigade prisoner who is on one knee."
"Argath stands before him, while Ramza remains off to the side, and Delita leans against a wall."
ARGATH We know you're of the Brigade.
There's no use hiding it.
Out with it!
The prisoner remains silent with defiance.
ARGATH(cont'd) What have you done with the marquis?
Where are you holding him?
"You were with your commander, Wiegraf, when we came upon you."
Where has he gone?
grows impatient( ) Mayhap a beating would loosen your tongue!
"Argath kicks the prisoner to his stomach, then pulls him up by the hair."
"RAMZA Enough, Argath!"
ARGATH Hmph.
Listen well.
"A great host, with the Order at its van, prepares a sweeping campaign that will bring to book your turncloak Brigade."
You will die.
"You will be hunted down to the last and slaughtered like the swine you are, for such is brigandry's reward."
"But you, pig, are a lucky one."
"Tell us what we wish to know, and you may yet keep your bacon."
"So, where is Wiegraf?"
"CORPSE BRIGADE PRISONER How the bloody hell should I know?24.Argath kicks him again, sending him flying backwards."
"ARGATH I'll not bear your ribald tongue, rogue!"
"Learn to guard it, if you'd not have it cut from your throat!"
CORPSE BRIGADE PRISONER I am no...no rogue.
ARGATH Tell that to the men you've robbed!
CORPSE BRIGADE PRISONER You nobles are...all the same.
You think every man...born outside a castle's walls...less than human.
We fought for this kingdom at peril of our very lives.
Yet the moment the war was ended...you turned us out into the streets.
What do you think makes you so special?
Birth?
Blood?
What difference does it make?
"ARGATH You kidnap men for ransom, then dare ask the difference between us?"
CORPSE BRIGADE PRISONER No...The marquis's kidnapping was...
no plan of Wiegraf's.
He would never...hold a man for ransom.
RAMZA Then who?
Someone kidnapped the marquis Elmdore de Limberry.
The prisoner struggles to breathe.
ARGATH Speak!
"If not you, then on whom would you pin the deed?"
CORPSE BRIGADE PRISONER ...It was Gustav.
ARGATH Who is Gustav?
DELITA Gustav Margriff - lieutenant commander of the Dead Men.25.ARGATH So the Corpse Brigade was behind the kidnapping!
CORPSE BRIGADE PRISONER rises to a knee( ) No!
We're not like Gustav!
"We fight to end the aristocracy, not to become it!"
To be treated as equals - as the men of honor we are!
Argath kicks him a third time.
ARGATH What do maggots know of honor?
"RAMZA That's enough, Argath!"
"ARGATH So where is this ""Gustav""?"
PRISONER In the Sand Rat's Sietch.
ARGATH Sand rat?
DELITA You are not of Gallione - small wonder you've not heard of them.
"Sand rats are unique to the Zeklaus Desert, north of Dorter."
RAMZA Do any villages lie between here and the desert?
DELITA Villages?
No.
"At least, not anymore."
"But the desertmen once had a settlement on the outskirts, and its ruins remain."
RAMZA Then that's where we'll find Gustav and the marquis.
"DELITA Aye, like as not."
"ARGATH How can you be so certain?26.DELITA A ""sietch"" is a sand rat's burrow - his home."
EXT.
"ZEKLAUS DESERT, ""SAND RAT'S SIETCH"" - DAY A Corpse Brigade unit huddles along the perimeter of their hideout."
CORPSE BRIGADE KNIGHT Then you've heard?
About the Order?
They mean to strike us for true.
"CORPSE BRIGADE ARCHER Aye, I've heard."
So...what's to become of us?
CORPSE BRIGADE KNIGHT I say we forget this business and run.
There's naught for it.
CORPSE BRIGADE MONK Agreed.
"If we follow Wiegraf, he will lead us only to our graves."
"CORPSE BRIGADE KNIGHT Aye, that much is plain."
"Gods be good, Gustav's ransom of the marquis will fatten our purses enough that we can quit this life for good and all."
CORPSE BRIGADE ARCHER The Order...they're here!
"Ramza, Delita and Argath take to arms."
RAMZA We must silence this watch before they can raise the alarm!
They defeat the lookouts before more troops can be summoned.
RAMZA(cont'd) The sand rats are long in the slaying.
It is well no others have found us while we tarried here.
INT.
"ZEKLAUS DESERT, ""SAND RAT'S SIETCH"" CELLAR - DAY WIEGRAF, the White Knight, and GUSTAV stand opposite each other, swords drawn.27.The marquis is on the floor, as are a few unknown bodies."
"WIEGRAF You've taken leave of your senses, Gustav."
GUSTAV Have I?
What hope does your fool revolution hold?
Dreams do not fill a man's stomach or make soft the packed earth on which he beds!
WIEGRAF You see naught beyond the end of your nose.
"The Crown strays, Gustav."
It must be led back onto the path.
GUSTAV And you think yourself the man to do this?
"More the fool you, Wiegraf."
WIEGRAF takes a step closer( ) You have spoken your fill?
Then we are done.
Gustav readies his sword and lunges at Wiegraf.
Wiegraf deftly parries and pierces Gustav through the chest.
GUSTAV Auh...ghh...
Wiegraf withdraws his blade and Gustav falls to the floor dead.
"Ramza, Delita and Argath enter, fresh from battle."
RAMZA Wiegraf!
ARGATH The marquis!
"Argath makes a move towards his liege lord, but Wiegraf aims his sword in the same direction."
WIEGRAF No further!
ARGATH How dare you threaten me!
"DELITA Stay yourself, Argath.28.WIEGRAF The marquis is unharmed."
You are free to return him to Eagrose.
RAMZA Why release him?
WIEGRAF The marquis's abduction was ill done.
Such craven methods serve not our ends.
"Let me walk free, and I will release the marquis to your care."
A fair bargain.
ARGATH You mock us!
You are in no position to bargain!
"DELITA holds Argath back( ) Enough, Argath!"
He speaks the truth.
"The three men slowly make their way to the marquis, keeping an eye on Wiegraf as he makes for the exit, sword drawn."
MARQUIS ELMDORE Ahh...Unh...
They turn for the marquis.
Wiegraf dodges out of the building.
"Argath starts to give chase, but Delita blocks his way."
"DELITA Let him go, Argath!"
ARGATH Why do you stay me?
DELITA The Corpse Brigade is finished in any case.
There is naught to be gained by a quarrel here.
RAMZA The marquis is well.
"He is weak, but he would seem unharmed."
DELITA We must see him back to Eagrose.29.INT.
"EAGROSE CASTLE, SOLAR - DAY Ramza, Delita and Argath are met with Dycedarg who is seated, scolding them for disobeying orders."
DYCEDARG What madness possessed you that you would abandon your posts to traipse about the desert?
off Ramza's silence( ) Silence is not the answer I seek.
"Speak, and be quick with it."
DELITA 'Twas I who forced Ramza to go.
"DYCEDARG Was that the way of it, Ramza?"
Delita led your better judgment astray?
RAMZA No...I went of my own choosing.
The fault lies not with him.
"DELITA 'Tis Ramza's noble disposition that guides his tongue, my lord."
"It is not as he- RAMZA You needn't be false on my behalf, Delita."
It was I who chose to disregard orders.
"DYCEDARG Might I pose a question, Ramza?"
What purpose do laws serve when even those who would enforce them choose not to pay them heed?
Adherence to the rule of law is a knight's solemn duty.
"It falls upon us, as Beoulves, to bear the burden of example."
Is your intent to live up to your name - or to drag it with you through the mire?
"RAMZA ...Forgive me, Lord Brother."
"MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) I believe the point is made, is it not, Dycedarg?30.A robed man with a white lion's crest on his cape enters from the back door and walks to Dycedarg's side."
"This is DUKE LARG, leader of the Order of the Northern Sky."
Ramza and Delita immediately kneel.
Argath quickly catches on and follows suit.
DUKE LARG You must not let the how of it steal your eyes away from the what.
Their rescue of the marquis was no small feat.
It is the way of young men to be impetuous in their haste to do great things.
We were not unlike them once.
"DYCEDARG To coddle them is to do them disservice, Your Grace."
"DUKE LARG So, you are Lord Dycedarg's younger brother."
"Rise, son of Gallione."
Ramza rises.
Delita and Argath remain knelt.
"DUKE LARG (cont'd) Indeed, you are the very ghost of Barbaneth."
"His fire burns in your eyes, I can see it."
Such strength and vitality would be wasted atop the castle walls.
"He glances at Dycedarg, hinting at something."
DYCEDARG Our campaign against the Corpse Brigade draws near its end.
I will permit you to join in the final stage.
Coordinated strikes are to be made on a number of their dens ere long.
You will lead one of those assaults.
"RAMZA Very well, Lord Brother."
Ramza nods and the three knight apprentices leave.
Duke Larg walks to a window while Dycedarg remains seated.
"DYCEDARG My apologies, Your Grace.31.DUKE LARG It was not of your doing, Dycedarg."
"In truth, it serves only to show the caliber of man we were dealing with in Gustav."
"A change in plans was inevitable, once the fool went and staged the kidnapping within our very borders."
And let us not forget - they did save the marquis's life.
He will now be honor-bound to acquiesce.
"In the end, your brother's deeds have placed us in quite the favorable position."
DYCEDARG The king's life hangs by a thread.
We must move quickly now.
"DUKE LARG Indeed, my dear friend."
I trust you will not fail me.
EXT.
BRIGANDS' DEN - DAY Heavy rain and winds beat down over a ramshackle hideout.
A small group of Corpse Brigade soldiers hide away.
Their leader MILLEUDA measures their losses.
MILLEUDA Our contact with the Brigade is lost.
And I fear we may be lost as well.
CORPSE BRIGADE MAGE #1 How could you say such a thing?
The battle is not yet even fought!
CORPSE BRIGADE MAGE #2 We mustn't give in to despair!
Not until the nobles answer for all they've wrought!
MILLEUDA It ought not have been like this.
My brother was too soft.
Too indecisive.
CORPSE BRIGADE LOOKOUT The enemy!
"Ramza, Delita and Argath make quick work of this waning branch of the Corpse Brigade.32.MILLEUDA How can you nobles live as you do and yet hold your heads so high?"
We are not chattel!
"We are humans, no less than you!"
What flaw do you hold there to be in us?
That we were born between a different set of walls?
Do you know what it means to hunger?
To sup for months on naught but broth of bean?
Why must we be made to starve that you might grow fat?
"You call us thieves, but it is you who steal from us the right to live!"
"ARGATH You, no less human than we?"
Ha!
Now there's a beastly thought.
You've been less than we from the moment your baseborn father fell upon your mother in whatever gutter saw you sired!
You've been chattel since you came into the world drenched in common blood!
MILLEUDA By whose decree!?
Who decides such foul and absurd things?
ARGATH 'Tis heaven's will!
MILLEUDA Heaven's will?
You would pin your bigotry on the gods?
"No god would fain forgive such sin, much less embrace it!"
All men are equal in the eyes of the gods!
"ARGATH Men, yes."
But the gods have no eyes for chattel.
"MILLEUDA You speak of devils, not gods!"
"DELITA Ramza, is this woman truly our enemy?"
Milleuda is eventually felled.
RAMZA Lay down your sword.
"Resist us not, and your life will yet be spared.33.Post-battle."
"Ramza, Delita and Argath interrogate an injured Milleuda."
"MILLEUDA I'm no more than chattel to you, am I?"
So have my head and be done with it!
RAMZA Do you truly hold us to be so foul?
"ARGATH Do it, Ramza!"
She fights as a Corpse.
Let her become one for true!
She's a foe and a traitor - an enemy of House Beoulve!
The world has no place for such wretches.
Her claim to life is forfeit!
"Spare her now, and you place your seal on the warrants for our own deaths!"
"It's her or us, Ramza!"
Strike her down!
"DELITA Try as I might, Ramza, I cannot think this woman our enemy."
ARGATH Have you lost your wits?
DELITA turns to Argath( ) This woman is no more chattel than you or I.
"ARGATH You would turn against our cause, Delita?"
I ought have expected as much!
MILLEUDA rises() You deny me even the mercy of an honorable death.
A pox on you and your pity!
"So long as you bear the name Beoulve, you will ever remain an enemy to me."
You'd do well to remember that.
Milleuda limps away as the three men watch her go.
RAMZA Delita...What have we done?34.Delita shakes his head in pity.
Argath takes a few steps away and crosses his arms in disgust.
ARGATH Hmph.
A pox on your pity indeed.
EXT.
"EAGROSE CASTLE, BEOULVE MANSE - DAY Rain and lightning fill the skies."
Thunder roars over a girl's screams.
"TIETRA No, I won't go!"
Release me!
"A band of the Corpse Brigade flees the castle, carrying Tietra away on a chocobo."
"Their unit leader, GRAGOROTH, secures their escape."
GRAGOROTH Be quick about it!
A Corpse Brigade thief drags Alma behind him.
ALMA Y-you're hurting me!
Let go!
Zalbaag!
"Zalbaag rushes out sword swinging, freeing Alma and slaying the thief."
GRAGOROTH flees() Hmph.
Time to cut losses.
"ZALBAAG Alma, are you unhurt?"
"ALMA Yes, I'm fine."
But Tietra-!
"ZALBAAG Yes, I know."
"Dycedarg joins them, limping in pain."
"ZALBAAG (cont'd) Lord Brother!35.DYCEDARG W-worry not, I am fine."
"Alma, are..."
are you all right?
ALMA They did not harm me.
But you - you're bleeding badly!
DYCEDARG In no fevered dream would I have thought the Brigade so bold to strike us here...They must have come for me.
"ZALBAAG Five among our guard are slain, and Tietra taken."
DYCEDARG Find them...Search every den and dovecote if you must.
"ALMA Please, Brother, you mustn't speak!"
DYCEDARG closes eyes( ) Bloody...rebels...
Dycedarg falls to the ground.
ALMA Dycedarg!
INT.
BEOULVE MANSE - DAY Ramza and Delita return to Eagrose shortly after their skirmish.
They have a word with Dycedarg who lays bedridden.
Alma and Argath are also in the room.
DYCEDARG I'm told you handled your duties most efficiently.
"Leave the cleanup work in our brother's capable hands, and take a well-earned rest."
You've done well.
Fear not for me...My wounds are not as grave as they might seem.
"RAMZA Lord Brother, what...what of Tietra?36.DYCEDARG Zalbaag will lead a full-scale assault on the Brigade as soon as their garrison is found."
Delita is taken aback.
RAMZA But-!
DYCEDARG The enemy is routed.
Less than a score of their number remain.
"Their leader yet eludes us, but time grows short for Wiegraf Folles."
RAMZA And for Tietra as well.
You would leave her to her fate?
DYCEDARG I have taken measures to ensure Tietra's well-being.
The attack waits upon her safe return - such time as that may require.
Tietra is as a sister to me.
I would never turn my back on her.
EXT.
"EAGROSE CASTLE, BEOULVE MANSE - DAY Delita storms off, enraged."
Ramza catches up to him.
"RAMZA Think matters through, Delita."
Where would you even go?
You must calm yourself!
DELITA Calm myself?
"My only sister is taken by cutthroats, and you would have me calm?"
He tries to leave but Ramza stays him.
RAMZA I would have you obey reason!
We know not where to begin.
To search now would be fruitless.
Delita grabs Ramza by the collar.37.DELITA Fruitless!?
You speak of my sister's life!
RAMZA chokes to get free( ) You heard...my lord brother.
He said he would not...abandon her.
"But there's little...we can do - Delita, I...cannot...breathe."
Delita releases him.
Ramza falls to the ground panting.
"DELITA Forgive me, Ramza."
Are you all right?
RAMZA I...I'll be fine...
Argath steps up from behind.
ARGATH I'd not believe a word of that fairy tale if I were you.
RAMZA You call my brother a liar?
ARGATH I do.
I would not go out of my way to rescue some common maid.
DELITA What did you say?
ARGATH I said he would be a fool to hold back an army for fear of spilling a few drops of your common blood!
"DELITA As I thought- Delita punches Argath to the face, sending him flying."
Ramza restrains Delita from landing another blow.
"RAMZA Stop this, Delita!"
DELITA Release me!
"Damn you, Ramza, release me!38.ARGATH wipes his lip( ) Hmph."
"It's as I've always said: Common blood, common man."
"You'll never be more than you were born, Delita!"
You don't belong in our world.
"You ought be licking our boots with the rest of you ilk, churl!"
DELITA That does it-!
"RAMZA Enough, Delita!"
"And you as well, Argath!"
"ARGATH Open your eyes, Ramza!"
Delita is not one of us!
It isn't proper that you should mix with such as he.
Surely you see that?
"RAMZA Delita is my friend, and a dear one."
We've been as brothers all our lives!
ARGATH And that blinds you from the truth!
"You're a man grown, Ramza."
It's time you left the playthings of your boyhood behind.
"You are a son of House Beoulve, a birth high even among the highborn."
Such company ill suits you.
"Your brothers see this, I am sure."
Even if you choose not to.
"Delita knocks Ramza away, but does not advance on Argath."
DELITA Not everyone of high birth is as ill- bred as you.
I'll trust to Ramza's judgment.
He turns and leaves.
Ramza confronts Argath.
RAMZA Begone from my sight!
And do not think to return!
"ARGATH Your words cut deep, Ramza."
Are we not friends?39.RAMZA Remove yourself!
I'll not ask again!
Argath shrugs it off and starts to leave before turning back to Ramza.
ARGATH The Brigade makes its base at Ziekden.
Your lord brother told me himself.
You've no hope of breaching the fortress from the fore.
Their defenses are too strong.
A rear assault is your only chance.
"Best of luck, my soft-hearted friend."
You'll need it.
RAMZA Begone!
Argath shakes his head then turns to leave.
EXT.
"MANDALIA PLAINS - EVENING Ramza and Delita rest along some limestone rubble, watching the sunset."
A hawk circles the sky above.
The two childhood friends commiserate.
"DELITA It's beautiful, isn't it?"
Do you think - do you think Tietra might be watching this same sunset?
"RAMZA Don't worry, Delita."
I am sure she is well.
"DELITA Something's been bothering me, Ramza."
For some time now.
RAMZA Argath's words trouble you.
Am I not right?
"DELITA lowers his head( ) There are things beyond the power of our changing, Ramza, try though we might.40.RAMZA Do not say that."
"If a thing can be endeavored, it- DELITA Will endeavor grant me an army?"
"I would save Tietra with these hands, if aught were in my power to do."
But I cannot.
'Tis my meager lot in this life...
"He clenches a fist, then spots a flower where his hand was blocking."
"DELITA(cont'd) Do you remember, Ramza?"
When your father showed us how to make a whistle of a blade of grass?
Delita plucks a grass blade to his lip and creates a whistling noise.
Ramza does likewise.
The wind carries their whistling over the fields.
EXT.
LENALIAN PLATEAU - DAY Ramza and Delita and again met by Milleuda and a fleeing Corpse Brigade unit.
MILLEUDA They guard this way as well.
No route is left to us out of these highlands.
CORPSE BRIGADE KNIGHT Then let us lower our weapons and raise the white banner.
"We gain naught by- MILLEUDA If I'm to die, I'd sooner do so swinging a sword than swinging from the gallows!"
I'll not be led away in chains!
Milleuda and her troops fight for their lives.
DELITA Where is Wiegraf?
What you done with Tietra!?41.MILLEUDA Tietra?
That Beoulve girl Gragoroth took hostage?
"DELITA Tietra is my sister, no more a Beoulve than you!"
"Please, she's no value as a hostage!"
"Return her, I beg you!"
MILLEUDA As you nobles return what you take from us?
"Our lives, our dignity, and all else that you have claimed as your own?"
We ask nothing more than that you return to us what is ours by right.
But you deny us even that!
"You take and take, until there is naught left."
Save your highborn breath.
"Your words are wind, and no amount of howling will see your sister free!"
DELITA But I...I'm not-!
Delita tries to persuade Milleuda to cease fighting to no avail.
MILLEUDA I mustn't fall!
Our struggle is not yet won!
Ramza grows tired of what he perceives is needless fighting.
RAMZA Why this struggle?
To what purpose do you fight?
Have we wronged you?
Have we somehow made you to suffer?
I do not understand what fuels your hatred.
MILLEUDA It is enough that you can stand there before me in ignorance of the misdeeds done us.
"You may not see the world beyond your high walls, but that does not mean they mark its boundaries."
It may well be you've done no wrong.
It is your place in the world that drives my hatred on.
"You bear the name Beoulve, and that name is my enemy.42.After a grueling battle, Milleu is slain."
MILLEUDA (cont'd) F-forgive me...Brother...
RAMZA Why?
Why must it end like this?
RAMZA(cont'd) What am I doing?
What have I become?
INT.
"FOVOHAM FLATS, WINDMILL - DAY Wiegraf and Gragoroth are in the middle of a heated argument."
Several of their men have Tietra bound nearby.
WIEGRAF Why have you kidnapped this girl?
GRAGOROTH We had to take a hostage - there was no other way to escape.
WIEGRAF Then why not release her once you were clear of your pursuers?
Do not tell me this madness has taken even you!
"GRAGOROTH I am no Gustav, if that is your fear!"
"Think, Wiegraf."
"We've lost the greater part of our number, and the Northern Order draws us upon us from all sides."
She is of Beoulve blood.
A hundred swords - a thousand!
- could not buy our freedom with such ease!
WIEGRAF turns to Tietra( ) So we fly - what then?
Know you some happy haven in which we may alight?
"If we flee, they win once more."
As they have always won.
We must make for our children a fairer future than the past you and I have known.
They must not suffer as we do!
"The stone we cast might raise only the smallest of waves, but see how they crash upon the shore!"
Waves rich with our blood...43.GRAGOROTH Then you order us to our deaths!?
"WIEGRAF If by our deaths a single drop of noble blood should water the earth, they shall not be in vain."
GRAGOROTH Foolishness!
The only blood the earth will drink will be our own.
WIEGRAF shakes his head( ) The remainder of our forces should yet be safe in our fastness at Ziekden.
We must rejoin them - together we have the strength to strike!
GRAGOROTH deflates( ) And if they are already dead?
A Corpse Brigade messenger rushes in and whispers something in Wiegraf's ears.
WIEGRAF Milleuda?
Slain?
Impossible...
Wiegraf raises an ever-tightening fist.
CORPSE BRIGADE MESSENGER The company which slew here must approach even now.
"Your orders, Commander?"
WIEGRAF We quit this place at once!
We shall make for our fastness at Ziekden.
"The girl will be left here, Gragoroth."
CORPSE BRIGADE LOOKOUT (O.S.) The Northern Sky is upon us!
They attack!
The messenger rushes out.
Wiegraf makes a last-minute executive decision.
WIEGRAF They waste little time.
I shall hold them off here!
"Gragoroth, you will take the others and make for Ziekden!44.Wiegraf exits the mill."
"GRAGOROTH I will run, yes."
But I do not mean to die!
He takes a long hard glance at Tietra.
EXT.
FOVOHAM FLATS - DAY Wiegraf confronts Ramza and Delita outside the windmill.
WIEGRAF Your faces are known to me.
But I did not know that you would one day kill my sister.
Milleuda deserved a better death - they did not even send proper knights to kill her!
RAMZA She was your sister...I am sorry.
WIEGRAF I will not flee before her murderers.
I'll avenge Milleuda's death or die in the trying!
"Wiegraf, the White Knight, is enraged as he strikes."
"DELITA My sister, Tietra - you will set her free!"
WIEGRAF Your sister?
"Then you are a Beoulve, yes?"
RAMZA He is not.
"If it is a Beoulve you seek, address yourself to me!"
"WIEGRAF So, Gragoroth has erred."
But surely the girl must hold some connection with House Beoulve?
RAMZA You draw no distinction between our house and those who deal with us?45.WIEGRAF Should I?
"Well, it matters not."
There was no question as to her release.
We make not habit of holding hostages.
But first we've a score to settle.
You will see her free - if you live to see aught at all!
Ramza and Wiegraf cross swords.
"RAMZA Lay down your arms, Wiegraf!"
What end will more deaths serve?
WIEGRAF What end did my sister's death serve?
RAMZA We did not set out to kill her!
This quarrel need not be settled by the sword.
"Let us treat, and persist not in this bloodshed!"
WIEGRAF You see it not - the reason we hold fast to our steel!
What advantage might I hope to enjoy at the treaty table?
And who would set a seat for me there?
You?
"Even were it in your power, your brothers would never heed any agreement we might reach!"
RAMZA My brothers do not want this fight!
"Set down your sword, Wiegraf, and my brothers will treat with you!"
WIEGRAF Ha!
No spoony bard could spin a sweeter tale!
You say your brothers do not want this fight?
"Tears then, for the world you see is one beyond my weary sight."
"Still they fight, with neither gaining the upper hand."
RAMZA You would have me believe my brothers plot at war?46.WIEGRAF Callow child.
The hands that guide history's reins are ever black with blood.
Think you Dycedarg's hand more just?
A new justice is born and dies on the lips of each man who would pronounce it.
RAMZA Do not mock my brothers!
Wiegraf falls to his knees from his wounds.
"WIEGRAF You fight well, boy."
"Forgive me, Milleuda!"
But there is too much left undone for me to lay down my life now.
"RAMZA Wiegraf, wait!"
WIEGRAF as he flees( ) Who do you think sent Gustav to kidnap Marquis Elmdore?
"It was none other than your lord brother, Dycedarg."
"With Lord Zalbaag's approval, to be sure."
RAMZA Absurd!
Why would Dycedarg do such a thing?
WIEGRAF The Lions vie for power in the void left by the king's death.
"I speak, of course, of Larg, the White Lion, and Goltanna, the Black."
"Each hopes to learn who may be counted as friend, and who as foe."
But such things are not so easily read.
"Easier rid yourself of those whose loyalty is uncertain, and install others to rule in their stead."
"I fear Gustav, fool that he was, tired of our rebellion, and was taken in by the silver tongue of your dear brother, Dycedarg."
RAMZA Lies!
No Beoulve would do a thing so craven as this!47.WIEGRAF Do not take my word for it.
Judge their actions for yourself.
"Farewell, young Beoulve."
Wiegraf escapes the battlefield.
RAMZA Wiegraf!
Coward!
"You insult my name, and flee in the same breath!"
INT.
"FOVOHAM FLATS, WINDMILL - LATER Ramza and Delita rush inside the shed after the battle."
Delita searches every crate and corner.
DELITA Tietra!
"Tietra, where are you!?"
She's not here.
Where have they taken her!?
RAMZA Wiegraf has lied to us!
"Come, Delita!"
We must hurry to Ziekden.
"Tietra is there, I'm certain of it."
DELITA Why?
Why is this happening?
"Why, Ramza?"
Why Tietra?
"Delita falls to his knees, helpless and sobbing."
"RAMZA I'm sorry, Delita..."
EXT.
ZIEKDEN FORTRESS - DAY A snow-dusted keep where a few remaining Corpse Brigade stragglers take refuge.
A Northern Sky unit holds its position firm around the perimeter.
"Zalbaag and Argath stand below Gragoroth, who holds Tietra hostage on a rampart bridge."
GRAGOROTH Back whence you came!
"Quick as shadows, or this one's blood makes crimson snow!"
Do not think to try my patience!
(MORE)48.This keep packs such a store ofGRAGOROTH (cont'd) powder as you could scarce imagine!
"More than enough to deliver the lot of you to the Father's keeping, should your feet lack proper haste!"
ZALBAAG The Order of the Northern Sky yields not before the braying of rogues!
Ramza and Delita rush to the fray just in the nick of time.
RAMZA Lord Brother!
Argath!
DELITA Tietra!
TIETRA Delita-!
GRAGOROTH Withdraw at once!
I'll not warn you again!
"ZALBAAG This changes nothing, Argath."
Loose your attack!
"ARGATH Yes, my lord!"
"Argath nocks a crossbow, and in a surprising act, fires a bolt through Tietra's heart."
She falls limp.
Delita and Ramza are taken aback.
"Gragoroth, confused and surprised, backs away in shock."
GRAGOROTH Gods have mercy...
"Argath looses another bolt, hitting Gragoroth and knocking him off his feet."
TIETRA D-Delita...I'm...sorry..
DELITA Tietra-!
Delita falls to his knees as another Northern Sky Knight appraises Zalbaag.49.NORTHERN SKY KNIGHT Lord Commander!
More enemies scale the pass!
"Two score, mayhap three."
A man of Wiegraf's look moves among them!
ZALBAAG Very well.
We go to greet them at once.
"I leave the rest to you, Argath."
Zalbaag leaves with the Knight.
GRAGOROTH Curse the lot of you...
Gragoroth slowly backs into the keep.
DELITA Tietra!- Delita shoves Ramza aside.
A deep and vengeful hatred fills his eyes looking upon Argath.
"ARGATH And where do you presume to go, Delita?"
DELITA You whoreson dog!
"ARGATH It is to be a fight, then?"
I'm only too happy to oblige!
RAMZA still reeling( ) Zalbaag...Dycedarg...How could you?
ARGATH Come!
I will show you that common blood makes naught but a common man!
Argath whistles for troops to join him.
A snowstorm rages over the battlefield as Ramza and Delita fight their former friend.
"RAMZA Why did you do it, Argath?"
"What moved your hand?50.ARGATH Your lord brother's orders, Ramza."
What else?
"Would you have had us kneel before them, and offer up the Order's honor in exchange for the life of some common wench?"
RAMZA She was Delita's sister!
ARGATH Is it not time you awoke to the fact that we are different from them?
"They are of lesser birth, and so meant to play lesser roles in life!"
"Such is the nature of fate, Ramza!"
That commoner and his sister ought never have been here at all!
"Had they been mongering flowers on some street corner, she would yet live."
The fighting continues.
"ARGATH(cont'd) What of you, Ramza?"
Why do you now raise arms against us?
To turn your blade on us is treason!
You would turn your cloak and name yourself a traitor to the Order of the Northern Sky?
RAMZA But - the Order would never forgive what you've done!
ARGATH Does your naivety know no end?
"How ironic is fate, that one such as you would be born a Beoulve!"
Delita furiously charges at Argath.
"DELITA Make your peace with the gods, Argath!"
You die by my hand!
Ramza struggles against the bitter cold.
"RAMZA My birth was not of my choosing!51.ARGATH Spare me the bleating, you are no sheep!"
"You are a Beoulve, self-chosen or not!"
"Yours is a line of champions, of lords among men!"
"To do great deeds is your destiny, and your duty as well."
"Much is there that cannot be done, save by your hand."
It falls to you to see it so - to act where we cannot.
RAMZA I will not be made a puppet!
ARGATH You?
A puppet?
Don't be absurd!
"The puppets stand before you, Ramza!"
"Long have we danced for House Beoulve, that it might reign on history's stage."
"A dance that serves our ends, to be sure."
"The Beoulve name is our shield, behind whose aegis we've long thrived."
It is the way of things!
"People are used, and use others in turn."
How do you think you came to be where you are?
"You are loath to be used, yet you fain use others."
Even your so-called friend Delita!
RAMZA What do you mean?
Delita takes an injury.
"RAMZA(cont'd) Delita, you're hurt!"
DELITA Speak not to me!
"When Argath falls, my vengeance turns on you, Ramza!"
RAMZA Delita...
Ramza and Delita valiantly stave off Argath and his troops.
Argath continues to loose bolts at them from behind cover.
ARGATH Do not pretend at ignorance.
You know what must be done for name's sake.
"(MORE)52.You made that much clear on MandaliaARGATH(cont'd) Plain, when you put orders ahead of aiding me!"
RAMZA I-!
"ARGATH fires at Delita( ) Does it grieve you, Delita, to see the depths of your own weakness laid bare?"
No mere commoner can leave his mark on history!
You've not the power!
Be glad you know enough to lament it.
"'Tis all you can do, and more than you deserve!"
DELITA Is your forked tongue done flitting?
What I'd hear from your lips are not words!
"ARGATH Laughter, then?"
"Be not so hasty, Delita!"
"You'll hear that soon enough, when you are on your way to your dear sister's side!"
"DELITA I'll not be told what I will do, or when!"
"Not by you, nor by any other!"
"Together, Ramza and Delita finish off Argath and his troops."
ARGATH N-no...Not at...the hands of...
milksop rabble...
Post-battle.
On the rampart bridge.
Delita stands over Tietra's dead body.
Snow falls gently over them and the mood is somber.
Delita kneels to pick up his sister and holds her tightly in his arms.
"Ramza runs up to him, standing a good distance away."
"RAMZA I'm sorry, Delita.53.An EXPLOSION suddenly rocks the keep."
"It knocks Ramza back, and he looks around frantically."
RAMZA(cont'd) What was that?
He spots black smoke billowing from a tower window and beckons to Delita.
RAMZA(cont'd) Delita!
We must away!
Delita either can't hear him or refuses to.
A second EXPLOSION knocks Ramza off his feet.
EXPLOSIONS IGNITE ACROSS VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE FORT.
Ramza crawls along the ground as smoke blows past him.
He searches around the ensuing smoke and flame for Delita.
"Delita still holds his fallen sister, refusing to budge- Ramza vaults for the rampart, holding his arm."
RAMZA(cont'd) Delita!
Delita!
An engulfing fire rips through the rampart and the entire fort.
EXT.
ZIEKDEN FORTRESS - LATER Blinding snow in every direction.
"Calm, serene, and grey."
"Ramza limps along a ridge, crusted in blood and ash."
He walks as if numb to the world around him.
RAMZA (V.O.) I had lived my life the only way that I had known.
"But when the pillars of that life came crashing down, I did not stand and watch them fall."
The screen goes black.
"RAMZA (V.O.) (cont'd) I turned, and walked away."
END OF CHAPTER I54.CHAPTER II - THE MANIPULATOR AND THE SUBSERVIENT (We are once again in the present...) EXT.
ORBONNE MONASTERY - DAY A storm still rages following Ovelia's kidnapping by Delita.
An older battle-weary Ramza dwells over what he's just witnessed.
"GAFFGARION What's this, Ramza?"
Do you know him?
Agrias steps out from the Monastery.
AGRIAS He carries the princess with him.
They'll not be able to travel far.
GAFFGARION You mean to give chase?
AGRIAS What else?
I will not return to the Crown in shame!
"GAFFGARION Well, you'll have no help from us!"
Our agreement said naught of this!
AGRIAS I would not accept your help if you offered it!
A true knight is all too eager to set right what he has let go amiss.
The Lionsguard will serve the king's justice.
"Lavian, Alicia."
We leave at once!
"The Elder walks out, ignoring the rain."
AGRIAS(cont'd) Elder Simon!
You are unharmed?
ELDER SIMON The Princess..!
What of the princess?
AGRIAS shakes her head( ) She is taken.
I am sorry.
But you may put your fears to rest.
We go to rescue her!55.ELDER SIMON No.
"No, milady, you mustn't!"
You would only throw your own life away.
AGRIAS Your worry will find no purchase with me.
A knight is oathbound to render aid!
RAMZA steps forward( ) Then we must lose not time.
I want to go with you!
"I'll be no trouble to you, I swear it!"
"GAFFGARION Nonsense, Ramza!"
This is no concern of ours!
RAMZA I must go!
I must know if it's truly him!
"GAFFGARION The boy, eh?"
Ramza slowly nods.
Gaffgarion turns away and steps off.
"GAFFGARION (cont'd) Well, there it is."
Gods know where this path leads us.
EXT.
"MERCHANT CITY OF DORTER, ALLEYWAY - DAY A Knight in Templarate robes haggles with a back-alley sellsword."
TEMPLAR A purse of five hundred gil per head.
"SELLSWORD 'Tis coin I lack, not wits."
Two thousand or you can stick them yourself.
TEMPLAR Mayhap you forget the ease with which men are branded heretics.
"SELLSWORD Threats, is it?"
"A thousand, then.56.TEMPLAR Seven hundred."
I can offer no more.
SELLSWORD Done.
Let it never be said that I was aught but a pious man.
TEMPLAR I pray your newfound piety lends not itself to mercy.
"They will be here soon, and I shudder to think of your fate should any of them survive."
"Ramza, Agrias, and Gaffgarion enter the alley."
TEMPLAR (cont'd) Hmph.
No sooner speak the devil's name than he doth appear.
You've work to do.
Best be about it.
The Templar vanishes into the shadows.
"The sellsword turns to his target, only to regret it moments later."
"SELLSWORD Gods be good, that's Ser Gaffgarion!"
Seven hundred a head for this!?
He whistles for mercenary reinforcements.
GAFFGARION An ambush!
This day grows lovelier by the hour.
"AGRIAS If you'd not fight, the road home lies behind you."
"GAFFGARION While I make no habit of charity, I could not well abandon so goodly a wench to rogues."
"AGRIAS Do not patronize me, ser!"
They fight off the ambush.
AGRIAS(cont'd) We cannot linger.
We must find Lady Ovelia!57.GAFFGARION And how shall we do that?
Call out her name and hope she comes running?
AGRIAS Her captors have but one place to go.
The impenetrable walls of Fort Besselat.
RAMZA Then we must lose not time.
EXT.
ZEIRCHELE FALLS - DAY Delita and Ovelia are cornered on both sides of a bridge by a host of Northern Sky Knights above a raging waterfall.
"NORTHERN SKY KNIGHT Stand aside, ser!"
You are defeated!
"Surrender the princess, and no more blood must needs be spilt!"
DELITA Do you so enjoy the taste of lies?
Your orders are to see the princess dead!
"And once I've watched you feed the falls her blood, I'm to believe you'd let me live, a witness to your crime?"
NORTHERN SKY KNIGHT What foolishness is this?
"We came to save the princess, not to kill her!"
What could we possibly gain by Lady Ovelia's death?
We wish only to see her freed from the Black Lion's claws!
"Ramza, Agrias and Gaffgarion arrive."
AGRIAS Your Highness!
OVELIA Agrias!
NORTHERN SKY KNIGHT Hmm.
It seems we are no longer alone.
Gaffgarion!
"Kill them all!58.GAFFGARION A change of plans...but a contract is a contract, after all!"
AGRIAS You would now betray us!?
GAFFGARION Betray you?
"You have a viper's tongue, milady."
I betray no one.
"I am in the Order's employ, and they are of it."
My task was to see the princess safely abducted.
"And theirs, to see the one responsible silenced."
AGRIAS You mean to say the kidnapping was a ruse?
GAFFGARION The princess is an obstacle to the throne.
"So long as she lives, the threat remains that someone could assert her claim above Prince Orinus's."
Two heirs are one too many!
Delita shields Ovelia.
"DELITA If her death is certain, then let it least not be in vain."
"Kill her if you must, but let it be held she was taken by Goltanna's men."
"Do that, and the stroke that fells a problem princess at once brings down a rival Lion."
That was no doubt Larg's plan all along...Or was it his?
Such a plot has more the feel of Dycedarg's thinking.
"Would you not agree, Ramza?"
"GAFFGARION That one has the right of it, Ramza."
"Come, let us earn our pay!"
RAMZA No...not again.
I will not watch as sacrifices are made of the weak and innocent.
She will not be another Tietra!
Ramza and Delita once again fight alongside each other against the Northern Sky troops.59.RAMZA(cont'd) Delita!
You live!
DELITA So I do.
"And you, ever your lord brothers' faithful hound?"
RAMZA Are you mad?
I knew naught of any of this!
"What of you, Delita?"
You now play party to their plot?
DELITA Surely you jape!
I came to rescue the princess!
I would not see her made a tool for others to use to their own ends!
"GAFFGARION If you would lie, boy, at least lie well!"
You are no knight errant!
You were paid to take the princess.
Do not play the fool with me!
Name the man who bought your sword!
DELITA I sell my sword to no one!
Do not count me among your lot!
"GAFFGARION Spare me the lecture, I ask for a name!"
You'd have me believe some bright-eyed pup caught wind of this plan and rescued the princess in the name of justice!?
Who gives you your orders?
Who told you of this plot!?
DELITA That is not for you to know!
Delita valiantly protects Ovelia from the Northern Sky Knights.
"OVELIA Tell me, ser - are you friend or foe?"
"DELITA I am a human being, no different from you."
"Agrias rushes to Ovelia's side as Gaffgarion closes in.60.AGRIAS Hold on, Your Highness!"
I am coming to help!
GAFFGARION Do not be so sure of that!
AGRIAS Have you any idea what you do?
The path you tread leads only to perdition!
"An adopted daughter she may be, but a daughter of kings no less!"
To lay a finger on her is treason!
"GAFFGARION Of that, I am well aware."
But your daughter of kings stands in the way of kings-to-be!
"Princess or no, her worth is spent."
And those born of kings do not outlive their worth.
AGRIAS Do you mean to mock her!?
GAFFGARION No more than we are mocked.
Have you once seen a man of royal blood stay his hand when a commoner blocked his way?
"The only difference is that those of royal blood are protected by lackwits like you, who swear fealty without even a thought!"
"Even should the princess live, it would be only as a pawn in another's game."
To kill her now is a mercy!
AGRIAS Then it is a mercy I will not see her done!
"Amidst the fighting, Gaffgarion is felled."
GAFFGARION Damn it...
"He escapes the battlefield, and the remainder of the Order flee."
Post-battle.
Ramza and Delita converse atop the bridge over the waterfall.
Agrias keeps Ovelia behind her at a safe distance.61.DELITA Let the princess with me.
She will be safer in my care.
"RAMZA What is this game you play with us, Delita?"
DELITA Game?
I do no more than speak the truth.
You've made an enemy of the entire Order of the Northern Sky.
Where would you now take her?
Think Ramza.
This was Duke Larg's plan - and he would not act without counsel of the queen.
You cannot trust the Crown.
Would you then turn to Goltanna?
"No, that would be folly."
He would only offer up your heads in hopes of keeping his own.
"AGRIAS And what, ser, would you propose to do?"
"DELITA I would do only that which you, my lady, cannot."
RAMZA You speak in nothings.
DELITA So I do.
But pay it no mind.
I shall leave her with you for yet a while longer.
"Delita turns to leave, but Ramza stops him."
RAMZA Delita.
"I did not think we would meet again, but...I'm glad we have."
Delita looks upward at a lone hawk flying across the partly cloudy sky and a bright sun.
DELITA It was Tietra.
He clenches a locket in his gauntlet.62.DELITA(cont'd) She watched over me then - as she does now.
He lowers his fist.
Ovelia rises past Agrias.
"OVELIA Know that you go with my thanks, Ser Delita."
DELITA back still turned( ) Ramza.
I hope this meeting is not our last.
"Ramza, Agrias and Ovelia are left standing on the bridge."
AGRIAS I owe you my thanks as well.
But he's right.
The Northern Sky will not be long in falling on us now.
RAMZA This is the path I've chosen.
But what now?
Delita spoke true.
We've no allies to whom we can turn.
AGRIAS We could entreat Cardinal Delacroix for aid.
The Church of Glabados rules in Lionel.
Surely they would not refuse us.
RAMZA We'd be beyond reach of the Northern Order there as well.
Very well.
We make for Lionel.
EXT.
CASTLED CITY OF ZALAND - DAY A band of outlaws chase down a young man down the street into an alleyway.
OUTLAW SWORDSMAN You've nowhere left to run!
All we want is the Stone - we needn't take your life.
YOUNG MAN What stone?
"I have no stone!63.OUTLAW SWORDSMAN Do not play the fool with me, Mustadio!"
Do you forget that we hold your father?
It's simple.
"Give us the auracite, and your father lives."
"Right, then."
Seize him!
"The outlaws charge after MUSTADIO, a young machinist."
But he evades their pursuit across the rooftops.
"MUSTADIO I have a message for your keeper, Ludovich!"
"Tell him that if he lays so much as a finger on my father, he'll never see the auracite again!"
Agrias and Ramza happen upon the conflict from the other side of a wall.
AGRIAS What trouble is this?
I think that man is being chased.
"RAMZA I'd sooner avoid trouble, but we've no choice."
We must help him!
The three fight off Mustadio's pursuers.
RAMZA(cont'd) Are you all right?
"MUSTADIO I should be, yes."
Thank you.
You saved my life.
INT.
"CASTLED CITY OF ZALAND, ABANDONED HOME - DAY Agrias keeps a lookout while Ramza helps Mustadio with his wounds."
MUSTADIO Street dogs running for the Baert Trading Company.
AGRIAS The Baert Trading Company?
"MUSTADIO Ah, then you've heard of them."
But they're no ordinary traders.
(MORE)64.That business is only a front forMUSTADIO (cont'd) more...lucrative pursuits.
"Opium smuggling, slave trading - all manner of vile thing, on a grand scale."
RAMZA What did you do to draw the attention of such as these?
MUSTADIO I'm a machinist.
Do you know the history of my trade?
"AGRIAS They say the ruins of a lost civilization lie buried beneath the streets of Goug, the Clockwork City."
"Relics from the age of Saint Ajora, when airships numerous beyond counting filled the skies, and men of iron walked the city streets."
But the art of crafting such things was lost - if it ever truly existed at all.
MUSTADIO But it did exist.
"The ground beneath Goug holds the hulks of airships, and a thousand fragments of machines the gods alone know the working of."
A machinist toils to restore this lost legacy - to see these works brought to life again.
RAMZA The device you used during the battle - is that one of these machines?
"MUSTADIO What, this?"
Mustadio draws his weapon.
"MUSTADIO (cont'd) This is a weapon called a ""pistol""."
It uses an explosive powder to propel a metal projectile toward its target.
This one is of simple make.
There were once pistols said to fire projectiles infused with magicks.65.RAMZA Hmm.
AGRIAS So why do these hounds of the Baert Trading Company chase after you?
"MUSTADIO You said you were going to see Cardinal Delacroix, yes?"
The cardinal is a hero who fought in the Fifty Years' War.
To this day the people of Lionel honor him as such.
As does my father.
He believes that the cardinal is the only man who can keep the realm from descending into chaos.
"The cardinal will receive you, hear your plea."
And the princess will be safe.
AGRIAS And what is it you want?
MUSTADIO To go with you.
I have my own reason for wanting to speak with the cardinal.
AGRIAS That being?
MUSTADIO To save my father!
He is held prisoner.
The cardinal is my only hope to free him!
"Alone, I am just another machinist - the cardinal would never see me."
That's why I would join you.
AGRIAS You still haven't answered my question.
Why is the Baert Trading Company so interested in you?
MUSTADIO lowers his head( ) I...I cannot tell you.
Not now.
AGRIAS Then you remain here.
MUSTADIO No!
I must see the cardinal!
"You must trust me, please!66.Ovelia enters from an adjacent room."
Agrias and Ramza immediately kneel.
"OVELIA Very well, then."
You will come with us.
MUSTADIO You mean it?
"Thank you, my lady."
Thank you!
AGRIAS You stand before the princess!
Mustadio hurriedly kneels.
OVELIA There is no need.
You may rise.
They all rise.
AGRIAS Then it's settled.
We will trust to your word.
EXT.
"BALIAS TOR - EVENING Ramza, Agrias, Mustadio and Ovelia stop for a brief respite on their way to Lionel Castle."
"Agrias and Ovelia stand amidst some ruins and have a private word, seeing Lionel's ramparts along the horizon."
"AGRIAS Lionel Castle, Highness."
Do you see it?
Just beyond those mountains.
OVELIA We still have a long journey ahead.
Do you think Cardinal Delacroix will aid us?
"AGRIAS The cardinal is said to be a man with utmost devotion to the Crown, Highness."
"Even amid this turmoil he has held the middle ground, siding with neither Duke Larg, nor Duke Goltanna."
I do not think him a man to sully his honor by handing you over to either side.67.OVELIA I pray you are right.
Ovelia walks towards a tall tree.
AGRIAS He has influence with the Church of Glabados.
"A word from him, and the Church itself will take you under its protection."
OVELIA Would that I were born no princess.
Ovelia picks up some leaves and drops them gently to the ground.
AGRIAS My lady...
"Ramza notices the two deep in conversation from afar, and listens from behind a wall."
OVELIA My entire life has been spent behind sacred walls.
"The only sky I've known, hemmed in by slate and stone."
"Did you know, before I was sent to Orbonne, I was in another monastery?"
"When I heard I was to be the adopted daughter of the late king, and after- ever in a monastery."
"It's not been such a bad life, I suppose."
Only...
"knowing that men die, for no more reason than that I am the princess - it's almost more than I can bear."
"AGRIAS Highness, you must not blame yourself."
The fault lies with those who would use you for their own ends.
Ovelia drops another leaf.
OVELIA There was another girl at Orbonne.
"She told me she, too, had lived her entire life within the monastery halls."
We joked that we two should share so strange a fate.
"A funny thing to laugh at, don't you think?68.AGRIAS You speak of Lady Alma, of House Beoulve."
OVELIA My only true friend.
"What if Cardinal Delacroix makes to use me, like all the rest?"
Agrias goes quiet.
MUSTADIO (O.S.) Ramza!
Where have you gotten off to?
It's almost time to leave!
"Mustadio catches Ramza from behind, in the middle of eavesdropping."
MUSTADIO I didn't think to find you here.
What are you doing?
AGRIAS What news have you?
MUSTADIO All is quiet.
"It would seem the Northern Order hasn't reached Zaland, for the time."
Ovelia attempts to whistle with a blade of grass to no avail.
Ramza walks up to her and picks up his own grass blade.
OVELIA A friend once showed me how to do this.
But I'm afraid I've never quite gotten it right.
Ramza whistles.
"RAMZA Just like that - it's simple, you see?"
OVELIA Like this?
She does it correctly this time.
"OVELIA(cont'd) It's really not so hard, is it?69.The wind carries their whistling over the Lionel mountains."
INT.
"EAGROSE CASTLE, SOLAR - DAY Dycedarg and Gaffgarion plot at a table."
"DYCEDARG Our little mockingbird is taken wing, Gaffgarion, and it leaves me wroth."
We cannot have her free.
"Catch her, crush her, and make silent her song."
Lady Agrias's and the others' as well.
GAFFGARION And Ramza?
Dycedarg rises and walks to a dresser where he pours himself a drink.
DYCEDARG The fool.
"He soils our name, dogs my every move."
I thought this a chance to let him learn the harsh truths of the world.
But the boy is too stubborn.
"GAFFGARION Too much of his father's penchant for justice, that one."
DYCEDARG Father coddled the boy too much.
"If he stands aside, more the better."
"Should he interfere, there's naught can be done."
GAFFGARION And you his brother.
The blood curdles.
"If the cardinal moves to defend the mockingbird, what then?"
Duke Larg himself could not reach them in the umbrage of the Church's wing.
DYCEDARG Worry not.
That potentiality has been addressed.
GAFFGARION Ever three steps ahead.
"You are a frightening man, Dycedarg Beoulve.70.DYCEDARG Truly?"
"Would it not be prudent, then, to better guard your tongue?"
There are so many frightening ways to silence a bothersome one.
"GAFFGARION Come now, my lord, I am your ever- faithful man!"
And not near so stubborn as a particular Knight Devout - if I might be so bold.
DYCEDARG Be bold.
But let there be no more missteps.
"GAFFGARION On the matter of missteps, what buffoon did you charge with the princess's kidnapping?"
We were beset in Dorter as we gave chase.
"Not quite how we'd discussed, I'm sure you'd agree."
"Dycedarg walks to a window, looking out over the kingdom."
DYCEDARG The men I sent were found dead in the woods near the monastery.
"Someone has caught wind of our plan, and seems intent on disrupting it."
No matter.
"As long as Ovelia remains with Lady Agrias, we will have chance enough to steal back our prize."
"GAFFGARION I pray you're right, for both our sakes."
EXT.
"LIONEL CASTLE, GATES - DAY Ramza, Agrias, Ovelia and Mustadio arrive at the heavily fortified gates of Lionel."
GUARDSMAN What errand brings you to Lionel?
"AGRIAS I am Agrias Oaks, a knight of the Lionsguard."
My companions and I have journeyed from Orbonne Monastery seeking sanctuary.
"(MORE)71.By the grace of Saint Ajora, I betAGRIAS(cont'd) you, lay open your gate!"
GUARDSMAN The graces of Saint Ajora are in the keeping of His Eminence here.
All who seek those graces are given like treatment - the gates of Lionel stand open to them.
Raise the gate!
INT.
"LIONEL CASTLE, STUDY - DAY Ramza, Agrias, Ovelia and Mustadio meet with CARDINAL DELACROIX, who is seated behind a candle-lit table."
Agrias is in the midst of retelling the plot of Ovelia's kidnapping.
"CARDINAL DELACROIX I see, Lady Agrias."
"In such circumstances as this, I am fain to lend whatever help I can."
I shall dispatch a courier to Mullonde at once.
High Confessor Marcel will have this news from my own hand.
"We will expose Duke Larg's misdeeds, and ensure that no harm befall you, Princess."
"AGRIAS Your Eminence, think you the High Confessor will hear our plea?"
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Fear not, dear lady."
You are in my care now.
Princess Ovelia can scarce feel at ease while those tasked with her safety are vexed with such worriment.
You may enjoy the comforts of the castle - wanting though they are - while we await a reply from Mullonde.
"OVELIA You are most gracious, Eminence."
Thank you.
"CARDINAL DELACROIX So long as Saint Ajora is our guide, we have naught to fear, child."
"(MORE)72.to Mustadio( )CARDINAL DELACROIX (cont'd) As for you, my young machinist, I have given consideration to your troubles as well."
I will send a hand- picked company of my finest men to Goug to put an end to this Baert Trading Company.
"MUSTADIO Thank you, Your Eminence."
CARDINAL DELACROIX Conditioned upon this: I would hear the reason they choose to pursue you and your father.
"MUSTADIO That is - I mean to say it's not- CARDINAL DELACROIX Come, come."
Mayhap this will give voice to your words.
Delacroix pulls a crimson gemstone from his robes and sets it on the table.
AGRIAS A crystal?
CARDINAL DELACROIX You are familiar with the legend of the Zodiac Braves?
"AGRIAS In my youth, I often heard a fanciful tale of that name at mass."
CARDINAL DELACROIX What's this?
"Surely, Lady Agrias, you do not aver that the Church would mislead its flock?"
"AGRIAS No - no, of course not, Your Eminence."
"OVELIA Long ago, before the mountains had ceased their wandering and struck their roots into the earth, the Lucavi held dominion over the world."
"Twelve heroes there were, who came forward to challenge these Lucavi."
"(MORE)73.In a long and bitter struggle, theyOVELIA(cont'd) succeeded in driving the Lucavi to the spirit world, and Ivalice again knew peace."
The Twelve each bore an auracite crystal emblazoned with a house of the night sky.
"And so in time, they became known as the Zodiac Braves."
"Ever after, when discord and strife paid visit to the halls of men, they would return to save us once more."
"CARDINAL DELACROIX You have clearly been a most apt pupil, Princess."
OVELIA Elder Simon himself instructed me at Orbonne - which reminds me of another thing he said.
"Saint Ajora walked with the Twelve, and together they saved Ivalice from ruin."
"CARDINAL DELACROIX We call the crystals of the Twelve the ""Zodiac Stones""."
The stone you see before you now is a stone from that very legend.
The stone sparkles as if enchanted.
OVELIA Auracite - it exists?
I did not think it possible.
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Or that it held the sacred power to keep the Lucavi at bay, eh?"
"I confess, I feel some power deep within, but my eyes see only a common crystal."
"RAMZA Mustadio, are you well?"
The color has left your face.
"CARDINAL DELACROIX You have seen a stone like this one beneath Goug, have you not?74.MUSTADIO Machines whose fires have long since guttered out lie strewn in the tunnels beneath the city."
"But pass that Stone near them, and you can hear them stir."
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Then Baert seeks the auracite, eh?"
MUSTADIO nods() I do not know what power these Zodiac Stones hold.
"I know only that Ludovich Baert hopes to find some way to harness this power, and make a fearsome weapon."
"My father would not give them the Stone, so they took him instead."
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Put your worries from your mind, my young machinist."
The Church will see this matter is dealt with.
"Our forces will strike, and wrest the Stone from their hands."
"MUSTADIO Of...of course, Your Eminence."
RAMZA I will join the company that makes for Goug.
"MUSTADIO Thank you, Ramza."
"AGRIAS We would never have succeeded in reaching His Eminence the Cardinal without you, Ramza."
"You have my thanks, as well."
"OVELIA I can only wish you well - small aid, I know."
RAMZA Your words are all the aid I could ever ask.75.EXT.
CLOCKWORK CITY OF GOUG - STREETS Ramza and Mustadio cautiously walk the streets.
MUSTADIO Baert's curs are nowhere to be seen.
Yet there's no sign of a battle with Lionel's Gryphons.
Something's amiss.
I'm going to see what I can find out.
We'll meet afterward.
RAMZA Where will I find you?
MUSTADIO points south( ) The Goug lowtown is just down this road.
We're not like to draw much attention there.
RAMZA All right.
Watch yourself.
MUSTADIO Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.
The two split up.
EXT.
GOUG LOWTOWN - NIGHT Ramza awaits Mustadio around a few shabby buildings.
"RAMZA Where are you, Mustadio?"
You should've been here by now.
It starts to rain.
RAMZA(cont'd) Could he have been captured?
"An ill-looking man, LUDOVICH BAERT, appears from the shadows with a number of henchmen."
"LUDOVICH A friend of Mustadio's, eh?"
RAMZA Who's there?76.LUDOVICH Bring him out!
Another henchmen leads Mustadio in and forces him to the ground.
"MUSTADIO I-I'm sorry, Ramza."
RAMZA steps for Mustadio( ) Have they hurt you?
LUDOVICH Not a step further.
"Prefer to keep a little distance, if you don't mind."
RAMZA You must be Ludovich.
Let Mustadio go.
Now!
LUDOVICH I'm a reasonable man.
I just want the auracite.
"Once I have it, I'll loose him soon enough."
"So, where have you hidden it?"
Tell me!
Mustadio refuses.
LUDOVICH (cont'd) Is that how you want to play it?
Maybe this will hasten your speech.
You there!
Out with the other one!
"Another henchmen leads Mustadio's father, BESRUDIO, bound by ropes and also knocked to the ground."
MUSTADIO Father!
What have they done to you?
"BESRUDIO I'm...I'm fine, Son."
Don't tell them where it is.
LUDOVICH Show him inside.
The henchman shoves Besrudio inside the house.
LUDOVICH (cont'd) Well?
Feeling a bit more game now?77.MUSTADIO ...There's a chimney just behind Ramza.
You'll find it there.
"LUDOVICH Bring that to us, would you?"
Small enough work to spare your friend's life.
Ramza checks inside the chimney.
He indeed finds a sparkling gemstone.
He walks back to Ludovich.
RAMZA Let them go!
LUDOVICH Give me the Stone!
RAMZA Release them first!
LUDOVICH Toss me the Stone - then they go free!
"Ramza hurls the Stone at Ludovich, who catches it and marvels at its glow."
LUDOVICH (cont'd) A true Zodiac Stone...At last!
This should bring a smile to the cardinal's face.
"You've been most helpful, most helpful!"
Pity you've outlived your usefulness.
Kill them.
Ludovich departs.
RAMZA The cardinal was with them from the start!
Ramza and Mustadio fell the Baert henchmen to save Besrudio.
MUSTADIO My father...I hope we're in time.
INT.
"GOUG LOWTOWN, SHELTER - NIGHT Mustadio helps his injured father to his feet."
MUSTADIO Are you all right?78.BESRUDIO My wounds will heal.
But the auracite - they have it.
Ludovich will use it to wake the machines beneath the city.
"In time, he may even learn to harness the sacred power of the Stone itself...I never thought the man we'd turn to for help would turn on us."
There's naught we could do to foresee such treachery.
MUSTADIO Ha.
Are you sure?
BESRUDIO What do you mean?
Mustadio pulls out a Zodiac Stone from his pocket.
"MUSTADIO I thought something of the sort might happen, so I took the precaution of readying a false stone."
RAMZA And that's the one I gave Ludovich!
MUSTADIO The same.
By now they've probably realized.
"Ah, to see the looks on their faces."
RAMZA Then Princess Ovelia and Lady Agrias are in danger!
MUSTADIO Danger?
How?
RAMZA The cardinal was working with Ludovich to get the Stone.
"His gambit failed, but he may try to ransom the princess and Lady Agrias for it now instead."
MUSTADIO That's ridiculous!
He would only make an enemy of the Crown!
RAMZA Why do you think he wants the auracite in the first place?
(MORE)79.The people tire of war.
They tire ofRAMZA(cont'd) these endless struggles for power.
"They are afraid, and they seek salvation."
The cardinal means to use the legend of the Zodiac Braves to bring it to them.
"Only once he's gathered the Stones, he'll summon the Zodiac Braves and use their power to rule."
BESRUDIO Just so.
We cannot give the Stone to the cardinal.
RAMZA Then we must rescue the princess and Lady Agrias!
MUSTADIO And we will.
But the roads leading to Lionel Castle will surely be blockaded.
We'll never be able to approach from the fore.
"We go by ship, to take them unawares."
EXT.
PORT CITY OF WARJILIS - DAY Ramza arrives by ship and makes his way across the port.
RAMZA Cogs and gulls.
No hint of Lionel's Gryphons.
He spots Delita.
RAMZA(cont'd) Delita!
What brings you to Warjilis?
The two walk together alongside the port into town.
DELITA We have ears in many places.
Few things escape our hearing.
"RAMZA ""Our""?"
"DELITA I say this for your sake, Ramza."
Return to Eagrose.
Delve no deeper into matters of royal maidens...or those of sacred stones.80.RAMZA What have these ears of yours been telling you?
DELITA turns to Ramza( ) You think to save a princess from a burning tower.
"In truth, you would but set her on a higher floor."
There is only one person who can truly save her.
And that is what I mean to do.
RAMZA Just what do you imply?
"DELITA It's simple, really."
Noble endeavors do not always reach the end that we desire.
You cannot save the princess.
However hard you endeavor to save her.
You would do well to remember that.
Ramza appears dismayed as Delita turns away from him again.
"RAMZA What then is your end in all of this, Delita?"
I fear I do not know.
"DELITA The Dukes Larg and Goltanna, your brothers, and all the rest...They are all of them swept up in a mighty current - a current they cannot see or feel."
I simply swim against it.
Nothing more.
A flock of gulls fly over shore.
DELITA(cont'd) We'll meet again - I should hope.
Delita continues walking away while Ramza looks on.
INT.
"LIONEL CASTLE, STUDY - DAY Ludovich and Gaffgarion stand before Delacroix at his table."
GAFFGARION You would use the princess as bait to regain the Stone?
"I would not expect such cunning of a man of the cloth.81.LUDOVICH You've some gall to speak, sellsword!"
It was you who let them escape!
"GAFFGARION That I don't deny, but it was not my task to stop them!"
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Still your tongue, Ludovich."
We will hand Princess Ovelia over to Lord Dycedarg as promised.
That much serves us both.
But it is no concern of mine if those who know the truth of her kidnapping live.
I had no hand in it.
"Be that as it may, the thieves who stole the gem are now with them."
"If we use the princess to lure them out, we get two birds - and one Stone."
GAFFGARION I won't deny the truth of it.
But such a plan has risks.
CARDINAL DELACROIX Your reputation would not cast you so craven.
"GAFFGARION I am cautious , Your Holiness."
A soldier does not live to become old and grey charging onto the field of battle unawares.
CARDINAL DELACROIX Very well.
I will see that every possible precaution is taken.
And let us sprinkle a trail of crumbs to ensure they find our snare.
GAFFGARION A prudent move.
The maid's the perfect bait to lure them to us.
I'll assume responsibility for the rest.
Far better me than him.
LUDOVICH How dare you!
CARDINAL DELACROIX Very well.
"I shall leave the matter to you, Gaffgarion.82.LUDOVICH Your Eminence, you jape, surely!"
CARDINAL DELACROIX Go with my blessing.
GAFFGARION The Stone is as good as yours.
Gaffgarion leaves.
Ludovich pleads with Delacroix.
"LUDOVICH Your Eminence, you cannot mean to truth this to a man like that!"
Delacroix stands to meet Ludovich face-to-face.
CARDINAL DELACROIX I trust things to those who can be trusted.
Men who fail me time and again are rewarded in another way.
"LUDOVICH Y-Your Eminence, wh-what are you doing!?"
Delacroix moves in and executes Ludovich.
EXT.
BALIAS SWALE - DAY Ramza works at making his way towards sneaking into Lionel Castle when he notices Agrias running from soldiers.
"LIONEL KNIGHT Where've you got off to, gosling?"
Won't do to hide!
There you are!
Soldiers surround Agrias.
"LIONEL KNIGHT (cont'd) Come along quietly know, what do you say?"
Hrm?
"Before Agrias can draw her blade, Ramza comes to her aid."
AGRIAS Ramza!?
What are you doing here?
RAMZA I've come to rescue you.
I thought to breach the castle from its postern.
But why are you here?83.AGRIAS The cardinal betrayed us - was betraying us all along!
He plots with Duke Larg!
"We escaped the castle, but the princess was retaken."
I was returning to save her - and here you find me.
"We must hurry, Ramza!"
They are to execute her!
RAMZA First these.
Then the princess.
"Together, Ramza and Agrias finish off her pursuers."
"RAMZA(cont'd) Lady Agrias, are you all right?"
"AGRIAS I'm fine, but there's no time for that."
We must hurry to the princess!
They're taking her to the Golgollada Gallows.
"It's not far, but we've little time!"
RAMZA Of course.
With all haste!
EXT.
GOLGOLLADA GALLOWS - DAY Princess Ovelia stands before a robed executioner while guards look on.
"EXECUTIONER Got any words t'leave behin', puppet?"
"None, then?"
"Just as well, I s'pose."
LIONEL SENTRY Is that-?
The enemy!
"Ramza and Agrias arrive, blades drawn."
RAMZA We are come for the princess!
"Stand down, or take her place on the gallows!"
EXECUTIONER Ha ha ha!
And the trap is sprung!
"RAMZA Trap?84.The executioner disrobes, as does the ""Princess"", revealing Gaffgarion and a female archer in disguise."
"GAFFGARION Ramza, ever the gallant fool!"
RAMZA What have you done with Lady Ovelia!?
"GAFFGARION I've done naught with her, she's at Lionel."
What of the gem?
RAMZA Gem?
GAFFGARION Might we spare ourselves these tiresome feints?
I speak of the cardinal's gemstone.
"The one who stole it travels with you, does he not?"
I would have it surrendered.
"RAMZA If you want it, come and get it."
GAFFGARION So the boy now thinks himself a man!
Very well.
Let us finish this like men!
Ramza crosses swords with Gaffgarion's soldiers.
"GAFFGARION (cont'd) It is not too late to change your mind, Ramza!"
Return with me to Eagrose!
Your brother Dycedarg would fain forgive what's done.
He said as much himself!
"RAMZA Then let him forgive this as well, for I'll play no part in his foul plots!"
GAFFGARION Foul!?
You would paint your brother's deeds as foul?
A Beoulve must uphold the duties of his station!
You of all people should know that!85.RAMZA My lord brother seeks to ignite war to further his own ends!
"If such a thing is not foul, ser, then pray tell what is!"
GAFFGARION A man does not eat an omelette without breaking eggs!
Blood is the price of progress!
It is the ink in which history's pages are writ!
"Look around you, boy!"
Ivalice rots from within!
"Your brother would carve out the root of its decay, even if it means his hands must needs be soiled!"
Ramza refuses to yield.
RAMZA I will not stand and watch as Lady Ovelia is made to be another Tietra!
GAFFGARION Forget Ziekden!
There was no avoiding that.
"You are an heir of House Beoulve, Ramza, and you have a duty as such!"
It is your fate to see that duty fulfilled!
RAMZA As it was my fate to let Tietra die?
"No, fate had no hand in that."
Tietra died because I could not be bothered to save her.
I've lied to myself all this time.
It was my own inaction that killed her!
Agrias who has overheard this conversation makes her way to Ramza's side.
"AGRIAS Ramza, you are a Beoulve?"
GAFFGARION You didn't know?
"Aye, this little whelp is a son of the great House Beoulve."
"RAMZA I am my father's son, but that does not make me the same as my brothers!"
I knew naught of the plot to kidnap the princess!
I swear it!86.AGRIAS Do you truly think I would doubt you now?
You have more than proven yourself!
Gaffgarion grows increasingly impatient and frustrated.
GAFFGARION You truly are a fool!
"What is the life of one girl, when weighed against the greater good?"
RAMZA I see no good in using people!
"Only deception, and death!"
I will not stand by any longer as innocents fall prey to your good!
I will not let you harm the princess!
"GAFFGARION Then you seal your fate, you stubborn fool!"
"Unfortunately for Gaffgarion, Ramza proves otherwise."
"GAFFGARION (cont'd) Curse me for a fool, I'd not thought you'd grown so strong!"
I'd best retreat for now.
Gaffgarion flees.
RAMZA The castle - we must make haste!
INT.
"LIONEL CASTLE, DUNGEON - DAY Ovelia is on her knees with only a plate of food at her side."
Delita stands before her.
DELITA You've not touched your supper.
A princess cannot live on pride alone.
Ovelia silently refuses.
DELITA(cont'd) Do you think to starve yourself?
"None would weep, you know."
There are many who would be gladdened by your passing.
"Stop being stubborn and eat.87.OVELIA You were in league with the cardinal all along, weren't you?"
What do you mean to do with me?
"If you'd not give me over to Larg, then what is your intent?"
DELITA To put you where you truly ought to be.
"OVELIA So, you would manipulate me as well."
"I'll not do it, you know."
I'll not bend to your whims.
DELITA You will.
"If you wish to survive, you have no other choice."
OVELIA What do you mean?
DELITA I mean- Delita is interrupted when Delacroix enters with the robed Templar seen earlier in Dorter.
"TEMPLAR So, this is Lady Ovelia..."
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Do your spirits find you well, Your Highness?"
"If you would be but a tad more tame, there would be no reason to keep you in so cheerless a place as this."
TEMPLAR These seem lavish enough quarters for a false princess.
Ovelia blanches.
All eyes turn to the Templar.
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Ho ho ho...The girl does not yet know, Lord Folmarv."
FOLMARV Truly?
How pitiable.88.OVELIA Tell me of what it is you speak!
FOLMARV steps forward( ) Very well.
You are not Ovelia Atkascha.
OVELIA What...?
FOLMARV The true princess died years ago.
You are her double.
OVELIA That's absurd!
FOLMARV It is neither absurd nor untrue.
You are not Ovelia.
You are a straw doll placed in an empty crib by Council members who bear no love for the queen.
It was their intent that you would someday succeed the throne and relieve Queen Louveria of her power.
"They placed you in the royal family after assassinating the queen's two eldest sons, attributing their deaths to malady."
"The deception was complete, and your ascent all but sealed."
"King Ondoria was sickly, and seemed unlike to father another son."
"But against all odds, another prince was born."
"Whether he is in truth of Ondoria's seed is highly suspect, of course."
"Like as not, Duke Larg found some other sire to ensure his sister's place as mother to the king."
"Regardless, all of the Council's work was made for naught the moment Prince Orinus drew his first breath."
"Ovelia, crestfallen by this revelation, lashes out."
OVELIA You speak false!
"I'll not believe you!89.FOLMARV Believe what you like, child."
It is of little enough consequence.
You may be born a butcher's daughter for all it concerns us.
We hold a trump card in our hands.
The stock from which it was cut matters not.
"OVELIA What is it you wish of me, then?"
What would you have me do?
"FOLMARV Naught at all, sweet child."
"We only wish that you be our princess, as you always have."
OVELIA I am a daughter of House Atkascha!
I'll take no orders from you!
FOLMARV Oh?
Then what will you do?
"Let yourself fall into Duke Larg's hands, and you'll have a noose in place of a crown."
We only wish to help you claim the throne that is yours by right.
OVELIA ...Who are you?
"FOLMARV We are no friends of Duke Larg, nor do we sit in Goltanna's camp."
Think of us simply as...allies.
"CARDINAL DELACROIX Lord Folmarv, let us leave our princess to collect her thoughts."
"When she comes to see the reality of her situation, she will doubtless wish to be our ally as well."
"FOLMARV Indeed, let us give her time to stew."
The two men leave.
"FOLMARV (cont'd) Come, Delita!"
"Delita follows, leaving Ovelia to ruminate in solitude.90.EXT."
"LENALIAN PLATEAU - DAY Wiegraf, the fallen White Knight, kneels in front of a grave."
A broken sword stands upright in its mound.
WIEGRAF Milleuda...pray forgive me.
"I thought to deliver swift vengeance, yet here I am before you, my own blade sheathed beside me as yours lies sheathed within the earth."
"I have failed at much, but I shall not fail you."
Your killers will know vengeance!
"In this, at least, I shall not be disgraced."
MAN'S VOICE You speak of a thing beyond your doing.
Wiegraf stands to attention and instantly draws his sword.
WIEGRAF Show yourself!
A man in similar Templarate robes to Folmarv walks up to Wiegraf.
"This is LOFFREY, Folmarv's right hand."
LOFFREY Put aside your sword.
"I've no wish to cross blades with the leader of the Corpse Brigade, even if the Brigade itself is no more...My apologies."
"My words salt wounds still fresh, and that was not my intent."
Your men died valiantly.
WIEGRAF Make your purpose plain!
"LOFFREY My name is Loffrey, and I come at another's behest."
My purpose is a simple one: to find you.
We'd hoped you might be persuaded to work with us toward our common goal.
WIEGRAF Common goal?
Ha!
What jest is this?
Claiming the bounty on my head is no goal of mine!
"But that is what you seek, am I not mistaken?91.LOFFREY Pardon my presumption, but I do not think the tears upon your cheek those born of laughter."
Wiegraf's bitter expression returns.
LOFFREY (cont'd) It is not coin that we desire.
"It is our wish to rebuild Ivalice - to uproot her foundations, and see that she is not twice made slave to nobility."
"And that is what you seek, is it not?"
WIEGRAF You have my ears.
Loffrey takes a step closer.
LOFFREY Our ideals are not so very different.
"A fire burns in you, as it burns in us."
"Your strength, your passion - your spirit!"
We would welcome these to our cause.
WIEGRAF You mean to use me.
LOFFREY To every coin there are two faces.
Do you not consider the other?
"Join us, and our power becomes yours to wield."
"Have you, alone, the strength to avenge Milleuda?"
"Have you, alone, the power to grasp the reins of Ivalice?"
"Wiegraf sheathes his blade, turning his eyes back upon his sister's grave."
EXT.
"LIONEL CASTLE, GATES - DAY Ramza has silently breached the castle gates from its postern."
Agrias and company await below.
RAMZA Wait there.
I'll open the gate.
GAFFGARION Rather let it remain shut!92.Gaffgarion appears from the shadow.
"GAFFGARION (cont'd) You made your way into the castle well enough, but you overlooked the ambush."
RAMZA We're surrounded!
"GAFFGARION It's you and I now, Ramza."
"Shall we be about it, then?"
Ramza duels Gaffgarion one-on-one.
He slays Gaffgarion at last.
GAFFGARION (cont'd) I feel...cold.
RAMZA We must reach the princess before reinforcements arrive!
EXT.
"ZEIRCHELE FALLS - DAY Meanwhile, Delita has escorted Ovelia far from Lionel."
DELITA Your pace has slowed.
Are you weary?
We'll never make Zeltennia at this rate.
OVELIA Arriving sooner will no more make me a princess than arriving later.
That day you saved me at these falls seems so distant now.
"Your promise to cut me free from the strings of those who manipulate me - it was an empty one, wasn't it?"
"DELITA Empty or no, you've no choice but to follow me."
The hounds are loosed.
No bolt-hole is left to you.
"Run, and you'll still be hunted down as the princess who stands in the way of the throne.93.OVELIA Why must you say such things!?"
"Ovelia breaks from him, before noticing some strange men."
OVELIA(cont'd) Ah-!
NORTHERN SKY SCOUT Hmph.
I'd not thought to find the lady princess here.
That thrice-be- damned Gaffgarion must have failed yet again.
The man is naught but boasts and swagger.
Our orders are to kill on sight.
The princess does not leave this place!
DELITA Fools!
"If it is your wish to die here, then so be it!"
Delita protects Ovelia from the Northern Sky soldiers.
DELITA(cont'd) Was that enough to lift the gauze from your eyes?
"Bathe the earth in bitter tears, and it will still be all too content to drink your blood."
"Bemoan your fate and wait for it to claim you, or take my hand and live."
The choice is yours.
OVELIA It appears...I have no choice.
INT.
"LIONEL CASTLE, CHAMBERS - NIGHT Ramza and company reach Delacroix's chambers, only to realize that Ovelia is no longer in the castle."
CARDINAL DELACROIX I see Gaffgarion's sword was no match for his words.
"Then again, perhaps the fault lies with his adversary."
Beoulve blood is not given to spill easily.
"Even when thinned with that of a courtesan, it would seem."
Delacroix steps up to the dais.94.CARDINAL DELACROIX (cont'd) But enough is enough.
Your intrusions overstay their welcome.
"Leave the auracite, and then leave Lionel."
"A generous offer, and my last."
RAMZA Where is Lady Ovelia?
CARDINAL DELACROIX You mean to free her?
What then?
You've turned your back on your house.
A man cannot prosecute a war alone.
Forget this bootless struggle.
Think you mere will enough to see you victorious?
"Even will needs force, and you have none."
RAMZA Tell me where the princess is!
CARDINAL DELACROIX Gone to Zeltennia.
Her Highness has chosen to accept our hand in aid over yours.
RAMZA You lie!
CARDINAL DELACROIX Her Highness has taken her first step toward the throne.
"But she will need a steady hand to guide her, and yours falters."
"Who better, then, than us to stand at her side?"
She saw this - why not you?
There's no reason you should not join us as well.
The thought of besting your brothers holds no allure?
We care no less for this world's fate than you.
Together we can change Ivalice for the better.
RAMZA I have no wish to change the world.
But nor can I stand by while men suffer and die on the whim of some select few.
Do you truly believe you can change the world?
Not even I am so naive as that.
CARDINAL DELACROIX Ha ha!
Nescient humility from one possessed of such an artefact.
"(MORE)95.That Stone you hold can twist theCARDINAL DELACROIX (cont'd) very weave of nature, to say nothing of the world."
Yet I fear my words are wasted on you.
"Actions speak louder, yes?"
Delacroix draws a Zodiac Stone from his robes.
An amber aura fills the room and engulfs him in a burst of lightning.
"In a flash, he is transformed into a large hellish beast with fangs over its stomach, CUCHULAINN, the Impure."
CUCHULAINN THE IMPURE You take no pains to hide your wonderment.
How I shall delight to watch you die.
Each excruciation ecstasy!
The transformed Delacroix charges after Ramza but is slain - not even the power of the auracite can protect him.
"CUCHULAINN THE IMPURE (cont'd) How strange that I, Undying, here should die."
"A death come early, ere my master could return..."
"Delacroix explodes in the same rays of amber light, leaving behind only the Zodiac Stone."
INT.
"ZELTENNIA CASTLE, KEEP - DAY A robed man with a black lion's crest on his cape is surrounded by his advisors."
"This is DUKE GOLTANNA, leader of the Order of the Southern Sky."
Delita enters slowly and kneels before him.
DUKE GOLTANNA My advisors tell me you are the one who rescued Princess Ovelia.
I would have you tell me more.
"DELITA I am Delita Heiral, a Blackram lieutenant in the service of His Excellency the Baron Grimms."
His Excellency dispatched me to rescue the princess.
"And so I did, disguised as one of your own - a sheep in Lion's clothing."
"Now I have returned.96.CHANCELLOR GLEVANNE Heiral, you say?"
That is a name I've not heard before.
DUKE GOLTANNA I thought Baron Grimms and his Blackrams felled in battle against the Eye of a fortnight past.
DELITA Indeed.
That dark news spurred me to return with all the greater haste.
DUKE GOLTANNA How is the princess?
BISHOP CANNE-BEURICH She is weary yet from her long journey.
She sleeps as if among the dead.
COUNT ORLANDEAU Is it not true you brought a prisoner?
DELITA rises and turns back( ) It is.
Bring the prisoner forth!
A man in chains is brought into the room.
A Southern Sky knight follows close behind.
The bound man falls to his knees in front of Duke Goltanna.
DELITA(cont'd) Let us hear the reason for you attempt on the princess.
"NORTHERN SKY PRISONER 'Twas to stain Duke Goltanna's name, and keep him from Lesalia."
We thought to deny him the regent's seat.
DELITA Who gave you the order?
Duke Larg?
NORTHERN SKY PRISONER No...a close adviser of Duke Goltanna's seeking to curry Duke Larg's favor.
Chancellor Glevanne bristles at the prisoner.97.CHANCELLOR GLEVANNE Madness!
None among us would fain betray our duke!
"Silence this man, he knows not of what he speaks!"
DUKE GOLTANNA I would hear it nonetheless.
DELITA Who was it?
Name the one who gave the order!
NORTHERN SKY PRISONER I'd have our protection?
DELITA On my honor as a knight.
Speak!
NORTHERN SKY PRISONER 'Twas the man who stands before me.
Chancellor Glevanne.
CHANCELLOR GLEVANNE What!?
How dare you!
"I do not even know you, knave!"
DELITA Who put you to it?
The queen?
"CHANCELLOR GLEVANNE Stop this mummer's farce, I've naught to do with this!"
"DELITA To betray your liege lord is an unpardonable crime, Chancellor."
Delita draws his blade.
Count Orlandeau readies his; and the few other men in the room draw back.
CHANCELLOR GLEVANNE It was not I!
I know naught of it!
Delita plunges a blade into Glevanne who dies on the spot.
"DELITA Forgive me if I presume overmuch, Your Grace, but now is not the time for bandied words."
"The Order of the Southern Sky must march on Lesalia at once, and you with it!"
"(MORE)98.Give your enemies but a moment toDELITA(cont'd) collect themselves, and they will pin the chancellor's sedition on his lord."
Your Grace must strike before they are given the chance!
"Deny the prince's claim, and set the princess on the throne!"
EXT.
OUTSIDE FORT BESSELAT - DAY A gruesome battle unfolds.
Southern Sky and Northern Sky troops slay each other by the thousands.
"Arazlam narrates: ""Following his sack of the royal capital of Lesalia, Duke Goltanna banished Queen Louveria to Besselat for her hand in the conspiracy, and crowned Princess Ovelia queen."
"But Duke Larg, insisting that Prince Orinus was the true and rightful heir, at once crowned the child-prince and declared himself regent."
"Moving then to free the queen, Duke Larg dispatched the Order of the Northern Sky to Besselat in the name of the new-crowned king."
Duke Goltanna in turn set the Southern Sky to march in Ovelia's name.
"The curtain had risen on what history would one day record as the War of the Lions."" END OF CHAPTER II99.CHAPTER III - THE VALIANT Arazlam narrates: ""Three months had passed since the beginning of the War of the Lions."
"The conflict grows fiercer by the day, and the forces of Dukes Larg and Goltanna grow increasingly weary of the endless battle..."" INT."
"FORT BESSELAT - DAY Duke Goltanna sits with his generals: Count Orlandeau (the ""Thunder God""), the BARON OF BOLMINA, marquis Elmdore de Limberry, and VISCOUNT BLANCHE - all of whom appraise Duke Goltanna of the grim situation."
"BARON OF BOLMINA This past eventfall, the count stood at twenty thousand-forty if both sides be counted."
"Alone, we've sustained, ah, two hundred thousand wounded, as well."
MARQUIS ELMDORE The number of casualties does not concern me.
Nor does the depletion of our stores - these were to be expected.
"No, it is this drought that threatens us."
The markets are empty and tax collections fall short.
"With prices as they are, we can lay in supplies for another half year, at best."
VISCOUNT BLANCHE Duke Larg must surely face like difficulties.
It rained unceasingly in Gallione this season.
The grain rotted in the fields before it could be harvested.
COUNT ORLANDEAU The real trouble lies in war's wake.
There is no work.
Whole villages have been displaced.
"Orran tells me over one hundred thousand have already fled to Lesalia, and more pour in by the day.100.VISCOUNT BLANCHE Ha!"
I see no trouble in this!
Let Larg struggle to feed the mewling maids and his soldiers both!
COUNT ORLANDEAU It is no laughing matter!
"Should the conflict spread, we may find ourselves no better off."
Think you Zeltennia proof against such fate?
"I assure you, we are not!"
Has not the time come to chart a course to peace?
DUKE GOLTANNA Your fears are well founded.
But we cannot yet end this war.
"We shall treble the rate of tax, and keep a close watch on those who hope to profiteer in these trying times."
"As for those seeking refuge outside the castle walls, we shall tighten our patrols at the Limberry border to see they are turned back."
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Duke Larg suffers, as do we."
What better time to treat to peace?
"DUKE GOLTANNA You talk in circles, Orlandeau."
There can be no peaceful end to this.
"COUNT ORLANDEAU The kingdom cannot exist without her people, Excellency!"
No more than can we.
"In the Fifty Years' War, who bore a greater burden than they?"
Would you thank them now with higher taxes?
And it is not only the people.
Our soldiers are made to fight on rations that would scarce feed a child at his mother's skirts.
We cannot long sustain this war.
It is a matter of resources and resolve.
DUKE GOLTANNA Resolve?
Have you any?
These are the words of a coward.101.COUNT ORLANDEAU The Fifty Years' War was fought to drive back an invasion of our sovereign soil.
We were honorbound to fight!
DUKE GOLTANNA And in this war you do not feel so bound?
"You were never one given to hypocrisy, Orlandeau."
"Show leniency now, and they will only strike the harder."
"This fight is not only for ourselves, but for our people in equal measure."
The Crown cumbers them with its every act.
We fight to free them of such tyrannies.
VISCOUNT BLANCHE His Grace has the right of it.
"Besides, why lay down the sword with victory so near?"
"Your title is ill earned, ""Thunder God"" Cid."
Your gentle words would sooner stir a breeze.
COUNT ORLANDEAU Is victory so near?
My ears are deaf to its approach.
What see you in our plight that portends victory?
Or have you forsworn the use of your eyes?
VISCOUNT BLANCHE rises() I will not sit here and tolerate such insults!
DUKE GOLTANNA Enough of this!
"You disappoint me, Orlandeau."
Pray you do not disappoint me further.
Count Orlandeau silently takes a seat.
DUKE GOLTANNA (cont'd) I will say this but once.
Any man who cares not for the course I've chosen had best remove himself now.
"I will brook no further doubt, Orlandeau!"
"Ramza narrates:102.""Delita once told me he was swimming against some unseen current."
"If this current rushed towards war, and the world with it, what hope did I have to fight it?"
"I made for Lesalia to tell my Lord Brother someone dictated this war from the shadows - and to test my legs against the current."" EXT."
"MINING TOWN OF GOLLUND - DAY Snow falls incessantly over rooftops, crusted in black ice."
Ramza heads towards Lesalia and chances upon a man who has apparently stumbled upon a thieves' den.
ANGRY VOICES Where is he?
Where'd the shuffler steal off to?
Hear that?
He's on the roof!
"A gang of bandits encircle the man, ORRAN."
ORRAN I'm trapped...
The bandits' leader makes his way to the roof before Orran.
BANDIT LEADER It don't do to have strangers sticking their noses in our little hideaway.
"ORRAN Then mayhap you might hang a signboard above the door, so we would know this place for a den of thieves!"
BANDIT LEADER Ha!
The cull's got brass.
Too bad it's steel he'll be wanting.
Ramza also stumbles upon the brigands.
RAMZA Something is amiss here.
BANDIT LEADER A lot of visitors today.
Small matter.
Stick 'em all and be done with it!
Ramza fights off the bandits and saves Orran.103.RAMZA Are you hurt?
"ORRAN I am fine, thank you."
My name is Orran Durai.
And yours?
RAMZA I am Ramza.
Ramza Beoulve.
ORRAN taken aback( ) Ramza Beoulve!?
RAMZA What of it?
ORRAN 'Tis naught...Forgive me.
Might I inquire as to the direction of your travels?
RAMZA I make for the royal capital.
And you?
You are welcome to accompany us if our paths are the same.
"ORRAN A gracious offer, but I fear my road leads away from Lesalia."
RAMZA I see.
"Fortune be with you, then."
ORRAN And with you as well.
"Orran extends a hand, and Ramza grasps it."
Orran then turns to depart.
"ORRAN(cont'd) Gods willing, we may meet again."
Try to keep yourself alive in the meantime.
RAMZA I will do the best I can.
INT.
"ROYAL CAPITAL OF LESALIA, STUDY - DAY Ramza enters Zalbaag's study where he is clearly busy at a table with a book and pen in hand.104.ZALBAAG Sit, won't you?"
"You surprise me, Ramza."
I did not think to see you in Lesalia.
"Alma is here, you know."
I'm sure she'd be delighted to see you.
RAMZA Brother...I- ZALBAAG Yes?
RAMZA Can you not end this fighting?
ZALBAAG What nonsense is this?
RAMZA What purpose can it serve?
We Beoulves have ever fought to defend the people - not simply the Crown.
And now we fight for no more than our own glory.
"ZALBAAG You speak of things you do not understand, Ramza!"
"RAMZA It is you who do not understand, Brother!"
"All of this, this...war, has been plotted to some unseen purpose, Dukes Larg and Goltanna only puppets in some shadow play."
ZALBAAG A shadow play?
Pray tell how it ends.
RAMZA I...I do not know.
Our lord brother planned the princess's abduction to prevent Duke Goltanna from becoming regent.
But someone intervened.
"Princess Ovelia lives, and is now in Goltanna's care."
"Had the assassination succeeded, the Crown would surely have named Duke Goltanna a traitor and rallied its banners against him.105.ZALBAAG sharply rises( ) Do you stand here accusing our brother of having some hand in this business with the princess?"
You think a man of your own blood capable of such a thing?
"RAMZA So you knew naught of this, Zalbaag?"
ZALBAAG Enough!
"Who have you become, that you do not trust your own family?"
Begone from my sight!
Return to Eagrose and trouble me no more!
"RAMZA You speak of trust, Zalbaag, yet you show me none in kind!"
ZALBAAG What have you ever done to inspire my trust?
The mistake was my own.
Until today I had looked on you as a true brother.
But your mother's common blood forever stains you common.
You are not fit to bear the Beoulve name!
Ramza is visibly taken aback.
RAMZA You cannot mean that.
A Northern Sky Knight rushes in and addresses Zalbaag.
"NORTHERN SKY KNIGHT Forgive me, Lord Commander, but I've urgent news."
The Thunder God has broken through our lines at Dugeura Pass.
ZALBAAG Impossible!
He was supposed to be at Besselat!
Summon the War Council - all of them!
I go at once!
NORTHERN SKY KNIGHT Milord!
The Northern Sky Knight leaves with Zalbaag close behind.106.EXT.
"ROYAL CAPITAL OF LESALIA, GATES - DAY Ramza decides to depart without saying goodbye."
But Alma stops him just as he exits the castle gates.
"ALMA Ramza, wait!"
"RAMZA I'm sorry, Alma."
ALMA Did you think to leave without so much as a word?
RAMZA turns away( ) I...I've never been good at good- byes.
"ALMA lowers head( ) You won't be coming back, will you."
"RAMZA Delita lives, Alma."
ALMA What?
But how?
RAMZA He helped them kidnap the princess.
ALMA Helped who?
RAMZA At first I thought it Duke Goltanna - that Delita had sided with him to spite us.
But now I fear he may be working with people far more dangerous still.
It is they who wanted to thwart the plot to assassinate Princess Ovelia.
ALMA Is it true that Dycedarg planned her abduction?
RAMZA It is.
"I am sure he had his reasons, but I cannot see them for the blood.107.ALMA Then Tietra-?"
RAMZA -did not share her brother's luck.
Alma cups a hand to her mouth.
"RAMZA(cont'd) Listen to me, Alma."
"I know not who guides Delita's actions, only that they are to be feared."
I know not what evil lies at the end of this plot.
ALMA And Delita serves these people?
RAMZA I cannot be sure.
I am sure only that Delita has his reasons as well.
If only I could know them.
"ALMA You mean to fight them, don't you."
Her fear for her brother's life is palpable.
ALMA(cont'd) I'm coming with you.
RAMZA Are you mad?
That's out of the question!
ALMA I want to help you prove the truth of your words!
RAMZA No.
Not like this.
ALMA I would not want my daughter to meet the same fate Tietra has.
"RAMZA Alma, please..."
"MAN'S VOICE Ramza Beoulve, if I am not mistaken.108.The two Beoulve siblings are interrupted by a robed man, CONFESSOR ZALMOUR, a member of the Church."
He is trailed by a quartet of knights and mages.
"CONFESSOR ZALMOUR Ah, but I have you at a disadvantage."
I am Confessor Zalmour Lucianada of the Holy Office of Inquisition.
I come to bring you before the Office on charges of the murder of Cardinal Delacroix and suspicion of heresy.
You will come with us.
"Should you resist, you admit your guilt, and will be executed as a heretic."
"RAMZA If I go with you, I only prolong my death!"
"ALMA You must run, Ramza!"
Quickly!
CONFESSOR ZALMOUR Then your choice is made!
Put this heretic to the sword!
"Ramza is forced to fight Zalmour, a holy man who refuses to listen to reason."
CONFESSOR ZALMOUR (cont'd) Your violence against us is as violence against the gods!
But it is not too late!
Repent of your sins!
"Repent, and be spared!"
"RAMZA You name me a heretic, but why?"
What have I done?
CONFESSOR ZALMOUR So you pretend ignorance?
You slew Cardinal Delacroix to gain the auracite he held and offer it to whatever hellspawn you profane to call a god!
RAMZA You could not be more wrong!
The legends of your holy auracite are lies!
The Stones are magicite - they hold in them power for evil.
"The cardinal used this power, and it perverted him into one of the Lucavi!109.CONFESSOR ZALMOUR Is it not enough that you murdered Cardinal Delacroix?"
Must you now slander his name as well?
More's the pity.
You will only see the name Beoulve washed away in tears.
The fighting lingers on.
Alma puts herself at risk to protect her brother.
"ALMA Flee, Ramza!"
You must!
Those summoned before the Office do not return!
"RAMZA I will not flee while you remain, Alma!"
I would not see them name you traitor with me!
In staying you risk your own life!
ALMA I will not leave you to fight this battle alone!
Ramza and Alma defeat Zalmour's henchmen and wound the holy man to his knees.
CONFESSOR ZALMOUR Heretics who profane the gods must still face their justice!
You will yet meet yours!
Zalmour flees.
Post-battle.
Alma checks on Ramza.
"ALMA Ramza, you're all right!"
RAMZA As are you.
I'm glad.
None of this makes sense.
How could the Office of Inquisition have learned of the auracite?
Could the Church of Glabados be the ones supporting Delita?
What do they hope to gain?
ALMA Ramza?
You mentioned auracite.
Have you truly seen the Stones from the legend?
"If auracite is real, then - I think I may have seen it once, too.110.RAMZA What?"
Where!?
ALMA First you must promise that you'll take me with you!
RAMZA turns away( ) You persist in this?
Do you think I would risk putting you in such peril again?
I will not take you with me!
ALMA also turns away( ) Then I have nothing more to say.
RAMZA Do not act the child!
Your very life is in danger!
ALMA I should think it is.
I've acted against the Office of Inquisition.
Surely I am a heretic in their eyes.
They will come for me as they do you.
"And when they do, do you think Dycedarg will protect me?"
He would never do anything that might endanger House Beoulve.
"RAMZA considers( ) No, I'm sure our dear brother would not."
But you cannot come with me.
The danger is too great!
You must explain everything to Zalbaag and beg the forgiveness of the Church.
ALMA The one I saw - it was in Orbonne.
"A crystal, engraved with the likeness of a virgin maid."
RAMZA Virgo...I must reach it before they do.
"Thank you, Alma."
"Now go to Zalbaag, and do as I have said."
ALMA And just how do you think to enter the monastery?
"(MORE)111.You're a heretic, remember?"
Do youALMA(cont'd) think you will be welcome at Orbonne?
RAMZA Ah...
"ALMA So, you need me after all."
"RAMZA Fine, but only until we reach Orbonne."
"When it is done, you will come home."
ALMA I promise.
RAMZA I will hold you to it.
The two siblings depart for Orbonne Monastery.
INT.
"ORBONNE MONASTERY, UPPER VAULT - DAY Alma leads the way downward where Elder Simon has collapsed to the floor, as are a few priests."
ALMA Elder Simon!
"She rushes to him as Ramza enters behind, also coming to Simon's aid."
"ALMA(cont'd) Elder, speak to me!"
ELDER SIMON slowly rises( ) Uhhn...Lady Alma...?
What...what are you doing here?
ALMA Never mind that.
What happened here?
"ELDER SIMON You...you must leave this place at once, child."
It is not safe.
Men have come...come seeking the Stone.
RAMZA A Zodiac Stone?
Then it is as Alma said!112.ELDER SIMON The Virgo Stone is one of...one of the crown jewels of Ivalice.
It was given into our keeping when Lady Ovelia was brought here for her fosterage...as proof of her royalty.
RAMZA And the ones come to take it - who are they?
ELDER SIMON You are...Alma's elder brother?
"Ramza, was it not?"
"I beg you, my son - leave them be."
"Block their way, and they will only cut you down."
Voices and loud screams are heard from the floors below.
FIRST MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Where's the bloody Stone!?
SECOND MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Patience!
It's here somewhere.
We need only look harder!
"THIRD MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Come, this leads to the lower vaults!"
RAMZA I am branded a heretic and hunted by the Church.
Am I to assume the Stones I now possess are the reason?
Who are these men?
"Please, I must know!"
ELDER SIMON ...Very well.
High Confessor Marcel and his followers seek to restore the Church to prominence.
"As a first step, they have set Dukes Larg and Goltanna against one another to whittle down their military might."
"The longer the fighting lasts, the weaker the dukes become - and the more the people lose their faith in the Crown."
"RAMZA And by gathering these Stones, and reviving the Zodiac Braves?"
"What do they hope to gain from such a show?113.ELDER SIMON The support of the people, of course."
RAMZA Truly?
The cardinal used his Stone to infuse himself with the strength of the Lucavi.
"If such is the power of the Zodiac Stones, it is a power to rival that of any army."
Is that strength not what the High Confessor seeks?
ELDER SIMON You are unlike your brothers.
You remind me a great deal more of your late lord father.
You - you may well have what is needed to put a stop to their ambitions.
Simon wavers as Ramza stands.
RAMZA Wait here.
I am going after them.
ALMA And I with you!
RAMZA We cannot leave Elder Simon here alone.
Find a safe place to hide.
Wait there with him until I return!
ALMA Very well.
Ramza hands Alma the Zodiac Stones in his possession.
"RAMZA I shall leave the auracite with you, lest the worst befall me."
"If I fail to return, cast it into the Bugross Sea."
ALMA It pains me that I can do no more at times like this.
How I wish I'd been born a man like you.
RAMZA Don't be ridiculous!
Who would I ever turn to if I didn't have my little sister?114.ALMA Ramza...
RAMZA Take Elder Simon to safety!
"Ramza pursues the voices heard earlier, into the lower vaults of the monastery."
INT.
"ORBONNE MONASTERY, LOWER VAULTS - DAY Ramza descends a level lower where he comes face-to-face with a Templarate Knight, ISILUD, one of the men heard moments earlier."
ISILUD The mongrel follows our scent!
Mayhap it is for the best.
Heretic!
I shall have the Stones you carry!
"RAMZA You will have an offer of mercy, and naught more."
Lay down the Stone you've taken and you may flee with your lives.
ISILUD I've no more need for your mercy than for you.
"If you want the Stone, come and claim it!"
Ramza and Isilud cross swords.
"ISILUD(cont'd) Why do you persist in this fool resistance, Ramza?"
You are a Beoulve!
Why do you not heed your brothers' counsel?
Why!?
RAMZA It is because I am a Beoulve I do not heed them!
The Beoulve name stands for truth and justice!
It is not a tool to be used for selfish gain!
My lord father fought and died defending our people against Ordallia in the Fifty Years' War.
House Beoulve cannot now turn on its purpose and fight for the interests of a corrupt Crown and self-serving aristocracy!115.ISILUD Then let it fight for ours!
What we wish for is the same!
"Hear me, Ramza!"
The Church of Glabados envisions a world devoid of class divides - a world where all men can live as equals!
Saint Ajora spoke of such a utopia.
It is the Promised Land he foretold!
"Fear and doubt worry the hearts of the people, leaving small room for fealty."
You see this!
"Ivalice lists, Ramza, and threatens to founder!"
"Should we fail to right her course, this storm will claim her!"
RAMZA It is you who churn the waves!
You orchestrate this entire conflict!
You claim war to be the proper course for Ivalice!?
ISILUD Change does not come without cost!
"Revolution requires martyrs, and we require revolution!"
"The Crown is rotten, the nobility corrupt."
They must be made to pay!
The people deserve their justice!
"Help us deliver it to them, Ramza!"
"Join us, as your once friend Delita has!"
Ramza remains unconvinced.
"RAMZA Were it justice you desired, I would gladly help you see it done."
But what you truly want is power.
Power beyond that of any army.
You would free the people only to enslave them anew with the demonic power of the Stones!
ISILUD Demonic power?
The Zodiac Stones are vessels for the gods!
We would use their divine miracles to guide the people to greater glory!
There is nothing demonic in that!
RAMZA Few would consider it divine miracle when a man is made a demon.
(MORE)116.Or do you pretend not to know thatRAMZA(cont'd) their power transformed the cardinal into a Lucavi?
ISILUD What nonsense is that?
The only demon I see stands before me!
Was it not you who murdered the cardinal for the Stone he possessed?
Not that he would have long lived gathering the Stones behind our backs as he was!
Ramza strikes Isilud down to his knees.
ISILUD(cont'd) I will not be bested by this heretic!
But nor will I risk death for honor here.
Delivering the Stone is of far greater import.
"Know this, Ramza!"
The day of our next meeting will be your last!
He flees.
"RAMZA Isilud, wait!"
INT.
"ORBONNE MONASTERY, UPPER VAULT - DAY Ramza gives chase, returning to the upper vaults of the monastery."
It is here that he spies a familiar face.
ALMA Let me go!
"Wiegraf, now donning Templarate attire, stands before Isilud with troops at his beck and call."
"WIEGRAF Isilud, I will secure the monastery."
Take the girl and go.
"ISILUD C'mon, no need to struggle!"
ALMA Ramza!
Help me!
"Isilud leaves with Alma, while Wiegraf looks on as Ramza reaches the upper level.117.WIEGRAF So, Ramza Beoulve is here."
Do not be deceived by his youth.
He is a worthy foe.
Gird yourselves well for battle!
Wiegraf whispers a prayer as he draws his blade.
"WIEGRAF (cont'd) Milleuda, you will soon be avenged."
Ramza halts in disbelief at seeing Wiegraf.
RAMZA Wiegraf!
You live?
"WIEGRAF I have lived for this, Ramza."
How long has it been since we last met?
"RAMZA Then, you were a warrior who fought to make your dream reality."
"Now, you are only a thrall of the Church."
"WIEGRAF What troubled sleep have you known, to speak of my dreams?"
"No matter how sweet, a dream left unrealized must fade into day."
Only with power can dreams be made real!
I see the truth of it now.
"What good, dreams, without that power?"
You think me a thrall?
So be it!
"Your envenomed words succor me, for when at last you yield - as you must - their poison will consume you!"
"Ramza spars with Wiegraf, trying to reason with him."
"RAMZA I pity you, Wiegraf."
"Even as a man of broken dreams, you might still have been remembered fondly."
"Your ideas lifted the people, showed them the cracks in the age-old facade of the aristocracy."
"You acted on your convictions, and so ennobled those actions!"
But what would the people think now?
What would Milleuda and your fallen friends think of this barter you've struck?
Dreams built on borrowed stone are defiled before they are made!118.WIEGRAF What have you done that did not rely on the labors of others?
From birth you have wanted for nothing!
You can not know what it is to live the meager life we do.
"Reason may trick you to believe you do, but your heart can never know!"
Harsh is the world in which we live.
Harsher still than you can imagine.
You have neither right nor reason to pour scorn on me!
"Wiegraf has grown strong, but Ramza has grown stronger."
And the White Knight twice succumbs to his wounds.
WIEGRAF (cont'd) Do not think you've...won!
I hold the Zodiac Stone...Aries.
I will not...
fall so...easily!
Wiegraf flees outside.
"RAMZA Damn you, Wiegraf!"
EXT.
ORBONNE MONASTERY - DAY Isilud is already mounted on his chocobo with Alma in tow.
"Wiegraf crawls along the ground, a trail of blood behind him."
"ISILUD Wiegraf, you're wounded!"
WIEGRAF Go!
Do not...tarry here for me.
Ramza bursts from the monastery.
RAMZA Alma!
WIEGRAF Go...Isilud...
"ISILUD Forgive me, Wiegraf."
Isilud speeds away on his chocobo.
"Ramza cannot give chase.119.RAMZA Isilud, wait!"
WIEGRAF final words( ) Is this...how it ends...?
I have...
failed Milleuda.
Failed them all.
A bitter draught...So much left...
undone.
Cold rain pours over howling winds and thunder.
"The Zodiac Stone, Aries, falls from Wiegraf's robes as he collapses."
It suddenly rises as if levitating.
"A deep voice echoes from the gemstone, speaking directly to Wiegraf."
"THE STONE God Stone bearer, with me now do treat."
RAMZA The auracite...it speaks?
"THE STONE God Stone bearer, with me now do treat."
Your spirit and my flesh as one shall merge.
Life undying yours forever more.
WIEGRAF Is this the Stones' great secret?
"THE STONE Your ire and despair, their call I heed."
And so once more I ask: With me do treat.
"RAMZA Wiegraf, no!"
It means to deceive you!
WIEGRAF Help me...I beg you...
A spiraling light similar to the one that summoned Cuchulainn engulfs Wiegraf.
He transforms into a four-armed monster with a ram's head.
THE STONE The Gigas Belias have I been named.
Your plea to answer now my only wish.120.BELIAS THE GIGAS Is this the wonder of the auracite?
RAMZA Wiegraf!?
"BELIAS THE GIGAS Magnificent, the pow'r of the gods!"
"Nay, not only pow'r - so much more."
Sights unknown I see.
My mind a vessel filled with wisdom of a thousand years.
Ramza draws his sword.
BELIAS THE GIGAS (cont'd) Ha!
"You hurry towards your end, alas too soon."
Such power...Such power!
Belias teleports away.
Elder Simon stumbles from the monastery and falls into Ramza's arms.
RAMZA Elder!
What - what are you doing?
ELDER SIMON I...I had to bring you this.
He hands over to Ramza an old leather tome.
RAMZA A book?
ELDER SIMON Written by a man named Germonique...
one of Saint Ajora's disciples.
It was lost for a great many years.
Only recently did I discover it among the stacks of our reliquary beneath the monastery.
It chronicles the true tale of the Zodiac Braves - no detail is omitted.
"RAMZA Please, Elder, you'll tire yourself."
ELDER SIMON I am already...so very tired...I have lived a life of sin.
All these years I have turned a blind eye as the Church rotted with corruption.
"(MORE)121.With this book, you can expose theirELDER SIMON (cont'd) misdeeds!"
You can win...Alma's freedom...
"RAMZA Please, Elder!"
ELDER SIMON Ahh.
It is done.
My mind is now at ease.
"The rest, Ramza...depends on you."
You...you really are the very image of Barbaneth in his youth...you know...
Elder Simon dies in Ramza's arms.
"RAMZA Elder Simon, no!"
EXT.
"MERCHANT CITY OF DORTER, ALLEYWAY - DAY It is raining and the townsfolk rush to get indoors."
"Ramza makes his way through the same alleyway where he was once ambushed, only to be stopped by a foreign mage."
"OUTLAND MAGE You are the heretic Ramza, yes?"
RAMZA What have you done with Alma?
"OUTLAND MAGE If you want your sister back, you will come to Riovanes Castle."
And you will bring the Scriptures of Germonique with you.
RAMZA What importance is the book?
OUTLAND MAGE Surely you have read the Scriptures?
"RAMZA No, I haven't read them yet."
I assume they contain something of importance?
OUTLAND MAGE A blithe response.
"There are many who would kill you for that book, and you do not even now what it is you carry.122.Ramza lowers his head."
"OUTLAND MAGE (cont'd) Well, we have an understanding, then?"
The mage turns and leaves.
"[Note: A transcription of ""The Scriptures of Germonique"" is included at the end of this document] EXT."
"ZELTENNIA CASTLE, RUINS - DAY Ovelia is sitting in a courtyard amongst a number of doves."
Delita walks towards her.
DELITA So here you are.
They've been searching high and low for you.
He stops just short of her and feigns a bow.
DELITA(cont'd) I do hope this day finds Your Royal Highness in better spirits than those past.
OVELIA tempered( ) Do not mock me!
Please.
I could not bear it.
DELITA That was cruel of me.
I am sorry.
OVELIA What do you mean to do with me?
I am not Ovelia!
There can be no value in holding me.
No value even in my living.
She lays her head in her hands and sobs.
DELITA You are right.
You are not the Princess Ovelia.
We do not even know your rightful name.
"Whether even you be highborn, or low.123.OVELIA I had oft wondered."
"Of the royal family, why must I alone be confined to a remote monastery, so far removed from the seat of our Crown?"
"Even this I thought a burden light enough, if it meant the kingdom would know peace."
She gazes fondly overhead at a number of doves flying freely across the sky.
"OVELIA(cont'd) I played my part, yet still Ivalice runs red with blood."
All this suffering and solitude.
For what?
Delita stares contemplatively at an empty fountain just beyond her.
DELITA It has been the same for me.
"I was given the wardrobe of a nobleman, and so I played the part."
"A puppet, ever dancing for the amusement of patrons unseen."
This wretched world does not reward endeavor.
It is the patron and his troupe who are receipt - maggots grown fat on endeavor's corse.
Most men but play the part they're given.
Most live and die not knowing they play a part at all.
But I am past all that now.
I am their unwitting puppet no more.
No more...I will exact from them the price of their gluttonous feast!
OVELIA And just what is it you plan to do to them?
"DELITA turns to Ovelia( ) I will burn down this kingdom, and from its ashes build for you a new one - a kingdom worthy of you."
I will show you a world where your light will outshine the sun!
A world that will know no darkness.
He kneels and sets his hand on Ovelia's shoulder.124.DELITA(cont'd) And you will have no more need of tears.
OVELIA Such a world...is it possible?
DELITA I will not fail you in this.
"On Tietra's soul, I swear to you."
Ovelia embraces him.
"Delita appears initially shocked, but accepts and returns her embrace."
DELITA(cont'd) Dry your tears.
EXT.
GROGH HEIGHTS - DAY Ramza is met by a group of Southern Sky deserters in these rain-sodden hinterlands.
"SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #1 Pursued even yet, when we are fled so far?"
Have the gods no mercy?
RAMZA Is that a scouting party from the Order of the Southern Sky?
SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #1 We're through fighting!
You will not force us to return!
We're going home!
Better to live in the streets than to die in them!
We've had our fill of blood and death!
RAMZA I do not pursue you!
Pray heed my words!
It is not my wish to fight!
"SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #1 Aye, that much I'll believe."
Better to strike us down cleanly when our backs are turned!
Do not think us so green as to fall for your tricks!
We've seen our share of those as well!
SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #2 That man...Does he not have the look of the one on the handbill?125.SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #1 What of it?
SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #2 It's him - the heretic!
I'm certain of it!
"If we returned with him, might they not pardon our desertion?"
SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #1 You'd return to camp?
SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #2 Consider it!
The capture of a heretic is near as grand a feat as the capture of an enemy commander!
"If we delivered them his head, do you not think they would reward us with leave to return home?"
SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #1 The men who captured that general were dismissed honorably...
"SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #2 If we are to return to our homes, let us do so with our heads held high!"
"Were we to return now, it would be to a life of skulking in the shadows."
SOUTHERN SKY DESERTER #1 You speak true.
Let us return with him!
Or at least with his head.
It's not long for those shoulders anyway.
"He is a heretic, after all!"
"Come, let this be our final battle!"
Our freedom is bought with this godless man's blood!
"Once again, Ramza is forced to fight and kill desperate men who would gladly see him dead."
RAMZA I understand the need to hold one's own life dear.
But to hold it so far above all others...
Post-battle.
Ramza stands atop a blood-soaked hill over the bodies of the men he's just slain.
RAMZA(cont'd) Father...What would you have done?
A unit of knights approach from the base of the hill.126.RAMZA(cont'd) Is that...?
"It's Orran, riding a chocobo."
Four knights flank him.
ORRAN We meet again.
He rides up to Ramza.
RAMZA I see the Black Lion sits upon your breast.
"You are of the Order of the Southern Sky, then?"
ORRAN I am.
And it would seem we have you to thank for dealing with our deserters.
Ha!
"I must admit, I'd never thought I'd see the day a Beoulve lent his aid to our order!"
RAMZA lowers his head( ) The fight was not of my choosing.
ORRAN I know.
"You do not wish to shed blood, but it cannot always be avoided."
We're no different.
Do you think we hunt these men down out of enmity?
"Craven they may be, but they've not wronged us."
"RAMZA You knew who I was all along, didn't you?"
ORRAN I did.
I'd seen your name and face upon a bill.
"Inexpiable heresy, was it not?"
My mind reels at the thought of what you must have done!
RAMZA Have you a mind to turn me in?
ORRAN Why would I do that?
Our orders are to capture deserters.
They say nothing of heretics already hunted mercilessly by their own.
"(MORE)127.If I were one of those, I think I'dORRAN(cont'd) get moving before the lions at my heels thought to feast upon me as well."
"Ramza proceeds to leave in the other direction, but turns back to Orran."
RAMZA Why do you still fight?
"ORRAN So long as your brothers point their swords at our throats, we must."
"RAMZA If the White Lion lowered his claws, the Black would follow suit?"
"ORRAN No, I do not think it like he would."
"RAMZA Could you deliver a message to Count Orlandeau, if you should chance to meet him?"
There are men behind the curtain who goad the dukes for their own gain.
"We are all but puppets, dancing as they pull our strings."
It is those men we ought be fighting.
ORRAN I can deliver the message.
But why to the count?
RAMZA My father once told me Count Orlandeau was the only man he could truly call friend.
ORRAN I am the count's adopted son.
I will tell him what you've told me.
RAMZA Then you believe me?
ORRAN I do not know the reason these men seek the Zodiac Stones.
"If it is for the benefit of the people, I see no reason to raise protest."
"(MORE)128.But if they seek to use the legendORRAN(cont'd) for their own gain, I can assure you my stepfather will not sit idly by."
"It was not for quiet complacence he was given the name ""Thunder God""."
RAMZA You know of the High Confessor's plot?
"ORRAN Of it, yes."
But we have no hard evidence.
"Our spies are working tirelessly, but I suspect you know more than they."
"RAMZA If you did have evidence of the plot, would you then be willing to lay down your swords?"
ORRAN Such evidence exists?
"RAMZA The Scriptures - no, it matters not."
I simply wish to know.
"ORRAN Whether or not it would the end of this conflict, I cannot say."
"But my father, for one, would surely sheathe his blade."
SOUTHERN SKY KNIGHT from afar( ) Lord Orran!
We must press onward!
ORRAN turns() Very well.
Let us resume our march!
"Farewell, Ramza."
See that you keep your head about your shoulders.
Orran bids Ramza farewell as he rides back to his knights.
ORRAN(cont'd) Never think yourself without allies!
You do have friends - friends who would gladly lay down their lives fighting beside you!
And I count myself among them!129.Orran and his men ride off.
"RAMZA Thank you, Orran."
EXT.
WALLED CITY OF YARDROW - DAY Ramza happens upon a sibling quarrel that has taken a turn for the worst.
"The man, MARACH, is the same outland mage Ramza ran into earlier at Dorter; and the woman, RAPHA, wears the same foreign attire."
"MARACH Are you blind to the treason of your words, Rapha!?"
RAPHA Me?
It is you who cannot see!
"He uses us, Marach!"
"We are instruments of murder to him, naught more!"
"To stay would be to live out our days as the grand duke's cat's-paws, killing so he might keep his own hands clean!"
"Come, let us run away together while we yet can!"
MARACH Have you forgotten who it was who saved us when we had lost our parents to the war?
Grand Duke Barrington opened his heart and home to the both of us.
You would repay that kindness now with treachery?
We owe him a debt of allegiance.
We'd have died a beggar's death were it not for him!
"Try as she might, Rapha cannot make her brother see reason."
"RAPHA Feed us he did, Marach, but we were supped on lies!"
I know the truth of it now.
"It was the grand duke himself who set fire to our village, his hand hidden by the smoke of war!"
And do you know why - why he killed everyone we ever knew?
It was for our gifts!
"You and I possess power, and power is all he craves."
(MORE)130.He burnt down our entire village thatRAPHA(cont'd) he might claim the sacred power of our mantras for his own!
"Opened his heart, you say?"
The man is not possessed of one!
"It is you who need open your eyes, Marach!"
Marach slaps his sister hard across the face.
MARACH I'll not abide your ill-mannered tongue!
"RAPHA You know, don't you?"
You know of the...the thing he did to me.
"You are my brother, you know of this, and even yet you- MARACH Speak not another word!"
"You stir a rage in me, Rapha."
"I am your brother and your elder, and I will not have you question me!"
A Riovanes soldier stumbles upon the argument.
"RIOVANES SOLDIER There you are, Marach."
The heretic Ramza draws nigh.
"MARACH I am well aware, and long since made prepared."
RAPHA Marach...
They spot Ramza entering the city.
RIOVANES SOLDIER That's him!
Rapha uses this chance to flee her brother.
MARACH Rapha!
RAPHA Pray lend me your aid!
Only moments after the battle does Ramza recognize Marach.131.RAMZA You're the man from Dorter!
Did you not say you'd await my coming at Riovanes!
MARACH I did but deliver the grand duke's message as asked.
I do not need the Templarate's swords to slay some petty knight apprentice!
"Further into battle, Marach's soldiers grow increasingly confused."
"RIOVANES SOLDIER What is the meaning of this, Marach?"
Has Rapha betrayed us?
MARACH Pay my sister no heed!
I will put an end to her defiance!
The only slaying you need concern yourself with is Ramza's!
Leave Rapha to me.
RIOVANES SOLDIER But how will you explain her death to Grand Duke Barrington?
MARACH Did I not just tell you that is none of your concern?
"Breathe word of any of this to the grand duke, and that breath will be your last!"
RAMZA This girl is his sister?
He would kill his own kin!?
Marach falls in battle.
MARACH Damn it!
Do the gods favor a heretic over me?
He teleports away as the remainder of his forces are felled.
RAMZA Are you all right?
"RAPHA Y-yes, I'm fine."
Thank you.
I-132.RAMZA We will not be safe here should they return.
Let us find a quiet place to hide!
EXT.
"WALLED CITY OF YARDROW, ABANDONED HOME - DAY Ramza and Rapha take a respite from their wounds."
RAPHA Grand Duke Barrington has eyes for one thing: the throne of Ivalice.
They call him King already - King of the Forge.
"He fashions ever more and stronger arms, and trains mages enough for all the realm."
RAMZA His actions are guided from the shadows.
"There are others - men who promise to eliminate the dukes Larg and Goltanna, and dub the grand duke regent."
"RAPHA And you fight these men, when fighting them means you must be labeled a heretic?"
Why would you do such a thing?
"No, that is a silly question."
I know the answer.
But surely you must realize your efforts will earn you no thanks.
RAMZA I do not fight for gratitude.
I am a Beoulve.
I fight for the honor of my name.
RAPHA I'd not believe that for a moment.
You strike me not as the sort of man to fight for things so trite.
"No, you see evil and injustice before you eyes and cannot turn away."
You do not even think to seek reward.
Ramza is flattered yet humbled.
RAMZA You mistake me for a better man.
But we have spoken enough of me.
What will you do now?
(MORE)133.I must make for Riovanes.
They holdRAMZA(cont'd) my sister there.
"What of you, now that you've escaped?"
RAPHA I cannot leave.
Not without my brother.
"RAMZA There's a quarrel between the two of you, is there not?"
RAPHA He refuses to accept the truth.
"We were orphaned in the war, you see."
"We lost our parents, our home - all but our lives."
The memories haunt me even now.
"Climbing mounds of rubble in search of any scrap of food, the air ever thick with death's foul stench...That was the life from which the grand duke spared us."
"At the time, I thought it sure the gods had sent him."
RAMZA You were not alone.
He erected a great many orphanages in the war's wake.
It was a noble gesture of less than noble intent.
He wanted assassins.
"The orphanages gave him a pool of willing young minds, allowing him to select the very best to groom and train."
He must have seen some promise in you and your brother.
"RAPHA We Galthenas are the keepers of a sacred art, passed down through the generations."
"My brother and I are conduits, I of the heavens and he of the nether."
We channel their power through mantra.
Grand Duke Barrington desired that power for his own.
"When our elder refused him, the grand duke put our entire village to the torch."
All is grist that comes to that man's mill.
"If there is a thing he cannot have, he thinks it better that it not exist at all."
"To imagine the joy he must have felt when he discovered the two of us among the other orphans - it turns my stomach.134.RAMZA So when you learned of all this, you tried to flee..."
RAPHA My brother and I loved the man as though he were our father.
But even that did not stop him from...from-!
RAMZA For a man of his high station to so prey upon the weak - it is not meet.
MARACH'S VOICE (O.S.) I would have thought you fled farther.
A shadowy silhouette appears nearby.
"Ramza stands and turns, as does Rapha."
RAPHA Marach!
A frog bounces forward.
Marach uses the enchanted creature as a mediator.
"MARACH'S VOICE Heed my words, heretic!"
Spare no haste on your way to Riovanes!
"Tarry here, and you next meet your sister in the afterlife!"
"RAPHA Harm a hair on her head, and I'll have you there for company!"
MARACH'S VOICE Rapha!
You will accompany Ramza.
"Run, and the death of his sister hangs on your shoulders."
"RAPHA You play a craven game, Marach!"
This has naught to do with them!
MARACH'S VOICE I play no game!
I trust you know what awaits should you try my patience any longer!
"The frog explodes as Marach's final message is delivered.135.RAPHA Come, Ramza."
Let us make for Riovanes.
"RAMZA Forgive me, I did not mean to draw you into this."
RAPHA You didn't.
This madness is none of your doing.
INT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, DINING HALL - DAY Inside Riovanes Castle, DUKE BARRINGTON and a few of his men welcome the two Templarate knights, Folmarv and Wiegraf."
"BARRINGTON Ah, a warmest welcome to you both."
I do hope you've found my halls to your pleasure.
"They may lack the grandeur of Lesalia's, but I find they make up for it in other ways."
Castles built as seats of governance are so dreadfully plain.
Would you not agree?
There is such greater beauty in a fortress built for war.
Ivalice herself would seem to be in agreement.
Ever has she been ruled by men with power.
Some might take this latest upheaval as a sign that the Crown - in its austere seat - has lost the strength to keep her under rein.
FOLMARV Your summons spoke of matters more pressing than the style of Lesalia's keep.
BARRINGTON Must everyone be in such haste?
"rises() Very well, I shall ask you outright."
Will you not join your strength with mine?
"FOLMARV I am afraid your meaning escapes me, Your Grace.136.BARRINGTON As I said a moment ago, it is power that rules Ivalice."
Who do you think now holds power?
"Duke Larg, and the Order of the Northern Sky?"
"Duke Goltanna, mayhap, with the Southern Sky's swords at his beck and call?"
"No, I can assure you it is not they."
The ones who hold true power are the ones who hold the Zodiac Stones - the Knights Templar.
FOLMARV You think us the greatest power in Ivalice?
BARRINGTON The Stones are said to possess a phenomenal magick.
"If legend is to be believed, they were responsible for the cataclysm that laid waste to Mullonde in bygone days."
FOLMARV chuckles( ) Ah ha ha!
"Oh, forgive me."
I forget myself.
It's just - I would never have expected a man like yourself to believe in such utter fantasy.
BARRINGTON You mean to tell me that you do not?
Curious.
I had heard that the cardinal's death was somehow connected to the Stones.
FOLMARV Truly?
"As I had it, the cardinal had taken ill."
BARRINGTON Is that so?
"Might I ask, then, the reason you seek that young Beoulve?"
I can only imagine what he must have done to earn the label of heretic.
FOLMARV The inquisitors do not share with us the reasons for their decisions.
"BARRINGTON So, you know nothing at all."
How terribly convenient!
"(MORE)137.Still, I wonder if there could not beBARRINGTON (cont'd) some detail you are simply forgetting."
Marach!
Marach ushers a bound Isilud into the room.
ISILUD Father...F-forgive me.
FOLMARV Hmph.
Your meaning becomes clearer.
BARRINGTON I've taken Scorpio and Taurus for safekeeping.
FOLMARV You worthless fool of a son!
Folmarv slaps Isilud to the floor.
Another of Barrington's guards enter.
"RIOVANES KNIGHT Pardon my intrusion, Your Grace, but your long-awaited guests are at our gate."
"BARRINGTON Marach, would you kindly see to them?"
Both the guard and Marach exit.
Isilud struggles back to his feet.
"FOLMARV What is it you wish, Barrington?"
BARRINGTON sits back down( ) Cooperation.
I said as much a few moments ago.
"It would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, I assure you."
FOLMARV And if we were to refuse?
BARRINGTON Then I suppose I'd be forced to unmask the Church's plot for what it is.
"FOLMARV Stones alone prove naught.138.BARRINGTON In that you are correct, ser."
But it would be hard to say the same of the Scriptures of Germonique.
I dare contend they might generate something more of a stir.
"Duke Larg, Duke Goltanna - even the Council is like to raise an eye at those."
FOLMARV Where are they?
"BARRINGTON Oh, who could say?"
You of all people must know how easily such details can elude the mind's grasp.
"FOLMARV Wiegraf, see to the mage who left a moment ago."
I shall attend to matters here.
Wiegraf leaves as Barrington stands to arms.
BARRINGTON Do not think to threaten me!
This is a battle you cannot hope to win.
"FOLMARV No, it is one we cannot hope to lose."
"Who is there to oppose us, save you feeble-bodied humans?"
ISILUD Father...?
Thunder crashes outside and the sky turns dark.
"FOLMARV You misjudge the strength of your enemy, Grand Duke Barrington."
There will be no sport in killing you.
BARRINGTON You would raise arms against your host under his own roof?
Guards enter the room and prepare to draw their weapons.
But Folmarv simply bows his head.
FOLMARV The hospitality of your hall grows cold.
"(MORE)139.I fear I shall have to take my leave,FOLMARV (cont'd) once I've shown you the power of the Stones!"
A golden light shimmers from Folmarv.
The screen goes BLACK as a wave of bloody screams are heard.
EXT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, GATES - DAY Meanwhile, Ramza and Rapha are met at the gate by Marach and a host of sentries."
"RAPHA Please, Marach, heed my words!"
We can leave this place together!
MARACH Death is the price for disloyalty.
You know this as well as I.
The grand duke sees all debts paid in kind.
"Turncloaks are set upon by their once friends, hunted relentlessly until the end."
"To flee this day is to live your rest in fear, ever wondering when the knife will find its mark."
Such is not a life I choose to lead.
"If we but finish this one last task for him, the grand duke will release us both from his service."
He swore as much to me!
RAPHA Swore it on what?
His honor?
Do not tell me you believed him!
The man's words are honeyed poison.
I'd sooner deal with a devil.
They make not such effort to conceal their lies!
MARACH The grand duke would not lie to me!
"We need only kill that man and take the Scriptures from his corpse, and then our chains are cut!"
Ramza is once again caught between the siblings' quarrel.
"RAMZA What have you done with Alma?140.MARACH You fear for the life of your sweet sister, Ramza?"
"Hand over the Scriptures of Germonique, and you both may yet live."
"RAPHA His words are false, Ramza!"
Do not be taken by them!
"He will tell you whatever you wish to hear, and kill you both when he has what he desires!"
"Surrender the Scriptures, and you forfeit your only leverage."
"So long as you hold that book, your sister's life is guaranteed!"
Rapha and Marach injure each other equally during battle.
"RAPHA(cont'd) What you say is true, Marach."
There is no point in simply running.
These chains that bind us must be cut by our own hands!
"RAPHA(cont'd) Rapha, wait!"
Do not be foolish!
The two teleport from the battlefield.
"Once the battle promptly concludes, the gates of Riovanes opens slowly and an injured guard makes his way out."
RIOVANES GUARD Claws...and fangs...Gods have mercy...
Lightning flashes overhead.
RAMZA Pray let them be safe.
"Alma...and Rapha, too."
INT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, DUNGEON - DAY Alma sits sobbing in a corner when she catches wind of a deathly scream outside."
ALMA What is happening!?
The sound of swords clashing and soldiers shrieking as their bodies are torn apart fills the cell.141.A wounded knight stumbles in and collapses at Alma's feet.
ALMA(cont'd) Those wounds are terrible!
What...
what did this to you?
"RIOVANES GUARD A beast...beast with - oh gods, my limbs grow cold!"
"ALMA Be strong, ser!"
"RIOVANES GUARD B-begone...from here, my lady."
There is...only death here...
He dies.
"Alma reels in horror, hearing more fighting outside."
She escapes her cell.
INT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, HALLWAY - DAY Ramza stumbles upon a corridor littered with dead guards."
"Wiegraf stands at the end, his back to Ramza."
RAMZA By the gods...
"WIEGRAF So, you've come."
"Draw your sword, Ramza."
He turns to face Ramza.
WIEGRAF (cont'd) Not in the mood?
I hope you will not object to me drawing mine.
"RAMZA I pity you, Wiegraf."
"More than you can know...What must Milleuda think, to see you now?"
You would sell your soul to the Lucavi to slake your thirst for revenge.
WIEGRAF Revenge?
You think that is what drives me?
I have no such petty concerns.
I do not fight to avenge Milleuda's death.
"(MORE)142.I sow the seeds of chaos in the worldWIEGRAF (cont'd) of men, and reap the anguished cries of the weak."
"But worry not, Ramza."
Yours is a special case.
I shall kill you myself!
Ramza and Wiegraf duel alone.
"RAMZA Auracite is the work of demons, not gods - the Zodiac Braves, their unholy knights."
Heroes of a false legend!
WIEGRAF chuckles( ) All such tales of gods and their miracles are false.
"Those who would lead prefer that history suit their needs, and rewrite it to see that it does."
And why shouldn't they?
The fault lies not with them.
The reeking masses yearn for gods and miracles.
"It is their opiate, and they consume it greedily."
"The people do not endeavor towards greatness, but rather mire themselves in their petty strifes - shackles on the feet of man."
Their leaders give them no more than that for which they clamor.
It is history's oldest and most oft- repeated tale.
Do men exploit this weakness to dominate their fellows?
Mayhap they do.
But they succeed only because the people are eager to know such dominion.
Gods are only illusions born of man's fear.
It is they who see this charade for what it is and join in the pageantry who are to blame.
RAMZA And you?
You did not conquer your fear.
You turned to the auracite to find your miracle.
"WIEGRAF It is because I am weak, because I fear, that I turn to the gods."
(MORE)143.Can you claim to be free of weaknessWIEGRAF (cont'd) and fear?
"RAMZA No, but I endeavor to be so!"
WIEGRAF Your endeavors are soon ended!
Ramza strikes Wiegraf down with all his might.
WIEGRAF (cont'd) You are...stronger than I had thought...
Wiegraf teleports away.
"RAMZA You cannot run, Wiegraf!"
Show yourself!
Wiegraf reappears at a distance.
WIEGRAF This has gone on long enough.
An azure light spirals around him and he transforms once again into Belias the Gigas.
BELIAS THE GIGAS I am come.
"The battle is now joined, Ramza Beoulve!"
Behold for true fell pow'r of the Dark!
Ramza is once again pitted against a creature of the netherworld and he is once again victorious.
BELIAS THE GIGAS (cont'd) Unnnhaahhh!
Brought down by hand of mortal man!
Belias screams as he disintegrates in the same azure light.
He leaves the Stone behind and nothing else.
But Ramza does not mourn Wiegraf's loss this time.
He hears an indistinct scream.
RAMZA Alma!144.INT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, DINING HALL - DAY While escaping, Alma finds a numbered of dead soldiers strewn across the hall."
"One of them, Isilud, is just barely alive."
He is bloodied and calls out to her.
ISILUD Ungh...ahhh...
ALMA tends his wounds( ) You're going to be all right.
ISILUD My...my sword.
Where is...my sword?
I must stop him.
"Stop it...Won't you fetch...a taper, to kindle some light?"
It is so dark here...
ALMA It's all right.
You needn't fight any longer.
Rest yourself.
ISILUD Your brother...tell him for me.
The auracite...a foul work.
"Evil...My father...nay, that was no longer...my father."
Transformed by the auracite.
One of the Lucavi!
ALMA You should not speak.
ISILUD Ramza was right...It must be stopped.
It could destroy...all of Ivalice.
Such power...You must tell them.
Tell them all.
They must cease their fighting.
Together they must face a...greater threat.
Where is my sword?
My arm does not heed me...
ALMA Be still now.
I saw...its body in the hall.
My brother slew it.
It is done.
ISILUD It is dead?
Slain?
Then I might rest...In my doublet.
There is a piece of auracite.
You must give it to your...your brother for me.145.Alma reaches inside his doublet and retrieves the stone.
It sparkles in her hand.
ALMA I will.
ISILUD Thank you.
My eyes are weary...heavy with sleep.
Let me rest them for...
for a little while...
He lowers his head and dies.
Folmarv walks in and notices Alma.
FOLMARV Whose voice is that?
"Ah, so here you are."
I shall speed you to join the others.
steps for her( ) You needn't fear.
Your death shall be quick.
"He takes another step but stops abruptly, heeding a clairvoyant voice from the nether."
FOLMARV (cont'd) Belias?
They've defeated him.
Your brother is ill luck for us.
"Come, we're leaving."
"As he grabs Alma, the Zodiac Stone he possesses gleans."
FOLMARV (cont'd) What's this?
Virgo stirs.
You?
Could it really be?

I should not have thought to find our quarry here!
I had feared we might search another century or more and still not find you!
ALMA What are you talking about?
Release me!
"FOLMARV Do not worry, your life is safe."
"Now, come!"
"Folmarv knocks Alma out cold and teleports her away on his shoulder.146.Unknown to Folmarv, the Zodiac Stones given to Alma by Ramza for safekeeping drop beside Isilud's corpse."
EXT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, ROOFTOP Rapha stands face-to-face with Duke Barrington."
"BARRINGTON After all I've done for you, you now repay me with betrayal?"
"You owe me your life, you ungrateful wretch!"
You would not stand here today were it not for me!
Did you prefer digging through sordid heaps of rubble?
Or have you already forgotten that?
"RAPHA Oh, I recall that quite clearly."
"It was after you burnt our village, was it not?"
Shortly after you murdered my mother and father and everybody else!
It is not with betrayal I repay your deeds!
It is with vengeance !
Rapha draws a blade and advances on him.
Barrington in turn draws a pistol and aims it at her.
BARRINGTON Vengeance?
You truly believe that you are capable of exacting vengeance on me?
"I am your father, Rapha - the man who raised you from a girl!"
You cannot kill your own father.
Though you are welcome to try!
"Rapha hesitates, trembling."
BARRINGTON (cont'd) chuckles( ) You cannot do it.
Do you know why?
"The flesh remembers, Rapha."
"It remembers fear, cold and trembling."
But it will not always be so.
"In time, your fear will blossom into another flower - and I shall have that one as well."
"MARACH from afar( ) It's true, isn't it?"
Marach joins the two on the rooftop.147.MARACH(cont'd) You meant the words you spoke just now!
"BARRINGTON You turn on me as well, Marach?"
You truly are an ungrateful lot.
"RAPHA I'll kill him, I will!"
"MARACH Rapha, no!"
"Just as Barrington fires a bullet meant for Rapha, Marah rushes in to take the hit."
He shoves his sister out of the way and falls dead.
RAPHA Marach!
"Speak to me, Marach!"
"Oh, Father, no!"
Ramza has also made his way up to the rooftop.
RAMZA Rapha!
Marach!
BARRINGTON You must be Ramza.
Move no further!
"If you wish to help your brother, Rapha, bring me the auracite he carries."
It should be on his person.
Rapha checks Marach's robes.
She indeed finds a Stone.
"BARRINGTON (cont'd) Yes, that is it!"
Bring it to me!
Quickly now!
I grow impatient!
"A strange woman appears behind Barrington, catching him by surprise as she grabs him by the collar and tosses him off the rooftop to his death."
She's joined by another strange woman and the marquis Elmdore.
MARQUIS ELMDORE I wonder if you would not relinquish it to me instead.148.RAMZA Marquis Elmdore?
I thought you felled in battle- Rapha pockets the stone.
"MARQUIS ELMDORE No, dear."
This is not a game of hide- the-Stone.
Bring it here.
"A ghostly wind blows around Elmdore and his two female assassins, CELIA and LETTIE."
"RAMZA Guard yourself, Rapha!"
Those are no humans!
"MARQUIS ELMDORE You must be the heretic, Ramza."
I suppose I owe you my thanks.
Forgive me for not expressing my gratitude sooner.
I would have you know I am not a violent man like Folmarv.
Will you not yield the Stone of your own accord?
I do so hate to see blood spilt needlessly.
"Spare me the struggle, and I shall be glad to ask Folmarv to return your young sister."
RAMZA What have you done with her!?
MARQUIS ELMDORE Mayhap I did not make myself clear.
"I would have the Stone, if you would speak more of that."
RAMZA to Rapha( ) I cannot let worry sway me.
It must not go to him.
"MARQUIS ELMDORE An adoring brother you must be, to trade your sister for a stone!"
"After all you've faced in coming here, you leave her to her fate?"
"RAMZA I have no words for you.149.MARQUIS ELMDORE Indeed, it seems the time for words is past."
"Celia, Lettie!"
The girl carries the auracite.
Take it from her corpse.
"Ramza fights to protect Rapha from the reincarnated marquis Elmdore whose life he once saved, and his two assassins."
"Together, Ramza and Rapha manage to send them into retreat."
MARQUIS ELMDORE (cont'd) So...this is the strength that felled the Gigas - and Cuchulainn as well.
Celia!
Lettie!
"Come, this night is lost."
"If you wish to claim the auracite I hold, Ramza, you had best make your way to Limberry."
I shall await your coming there with bated breath.
"The three foes teleport away, leaving Ramza, Rapha and a fallen Marach."
"RAPHA Oh, Marach..."
EXT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, ROOFTOP - DAWN As the sun rises, Rapha remains vigilantly beside her brother's corpse."
"Ramza stands nearby, moved by her loss."
"RAPHA Look, Marach!"
A new dawn is risen!
Can...can you see it?
"So often we sat together talking, waiting for the coming of the first light."
"We'd talk of the journeys we wanted to make together, wouldn't we?"
"How when the war ended, we would go back and visit our old village."
"You remember, Marach, don't you?"
Don't you?
Tell me you do!
Tell...tell me you'll still go!
She buries her head in Marach's arms.
Ramza turns towards the sun.
"RAMZA to himself( ) Wait for me, Alma.150.The Zodiac Stone in Rapha's possession emanates a faint cry."
RAPHA What's this?
RAMZA The auracite cries with her.
It resonates with the grief in her heart.
Wiegraf's heart was full of sorrow as well...and despair.
And those feelings summoned forth-!
RAPHA to the Stone( ) You grieve for him as well?
Thank you.
RAMZA No Rapha!
You must not listen to that voice!
An crimson light engulfs Rapha and a pillar descends upon Marach's body which miraculously comes back to life.
RAMZA(cont'd) Do my eyes deceive me?
MARACH Uh...uhn...
RAPHA Marach!
MARACH Rapha...?
Wh-where are we?
Why...why am I here?
Rapha embraces her brother.
"RAPHA Oh, Marach!"
"Thank the gods, you're alive!"
MARACH Ow!
Do you mean to suffocate me?
Ha ha ha...
INT.
"RIOVANES CASTLE, DINING HALL - DAY As dawn wanes, Ramza walks one final time through Riovanes Castle's halls in search of his sister.151.He spies Isilud's body nearby, and the Zodiac Stones that Alma dropped earlier."
"MARACH (V.O.) A voice called to me in that land of pure white light, though whose it was I cannot say."
"""Return,"" it said to me."
"""Return to the side of the valiant - the one whose heart beats true."" Ramza retrieves the Stones from the ground."
RAMZA Another Zodiac Stone?
But why would it be here?
"Ramza narrates: ""I'd thought auracite a product not of godly fashion, but an issue of hands far fouler - a gateway of sorts for Lucavi into our world."" MARACH (V.O.) I know not by whose hands it came to be, but I do not think its evil inherent."
I believe it is the wielder who gives its power shape.
Ramza inspects the Stone in his hand.
"RAMZA I shall save you, Alma."
Come what may.
EXT.
RIOVANES CASTLE - NIGHT The flames of war lit across Riovanes dim into the night.
"Arazlam narrates: ""Frustrations with the stalemate growing, the Order of the Northern Sky recalled its full force from the war's now expansive front."
"They marched on Fort Besselat, with plans to turn the tide of the war."" END OF CHAPTER III152.CHAPTER IV - IN THE NAME OF LOVE (Final chapter...) INT."
"RIOVANES CASTLE, HALLWAY - DAY Ramza, Marach and Rapha stand among a myriad of dead bodies, grasping at clues."
MARACH I have not seen such slaughter.
There are corpses at every turn.
"RAPHA But your sister was not among them, was she?"
"RAMZA No, she's not here."
"MARACH They had her in the castle, I'm sure of it."
They must have taken her elsewhere during the fighting.
Three men from the Templarate arrived not long after you.
Three and no more.
RAMZA One became a Lucavi.
I killed him myself.
"Another, Isilud, was slain in the melee."
This third must have taken Alma.
MARACH No doubt he means to bring her to Mullonde.
"Mullonde is the seat of the Church's power, and they act in High Confessor Marcel's name."
Where else would he go?
RAMZA I wonder.
I do not think their High Confessor knows the true power of the Stones.
Consider this.
Wiegraf did not know their secret until he had struck his bargain with Belias.
"And by the look of things, Isilud died fighting the Lucavi."
"MARACH What are you getting at?153.RAMZA By inciting this war, the Church hopes to broaden its power."
Clearly this is the High Confessor's ambition.
But he only wants the Zodiac Stones for their symbolic power.
To sway the minds of the people.
MARACH Do you imply that someone is using the High Confessor's ambition to some other purpose?
Ramza nods.
RAPHA This third man in the Templarate's party.
Who is he?
"MARACH I cannot say for sure, but I believe it was Lord Folmarv, commander of the Knights Templar."
RAMZA He is the key.
MARACH What will you do?
RAMZA I travel to Zeltennia.
"Delita is there, and I must see him."
"MARACH He succeeded Baron Grimms in leading the Blackram Knights, did he not?"
RAMZA The Church and the Knights Templar manipulate Delita from behind the scenes.
"With luck, he can shed some light on who this Lord Folmarv is, and what he wants."
INT.
"ZELTENNIA CASTLE, STUDY - DAY Count Cidolfus ""Cid"" Orlandeau, the ""Thunder God"", stands at a window overlooking the fray of battle."
"Orran, the count's adoptive son, enters the room.154.ORRAN Welcome home, my lord."
COUNT ORLANDEAU turns() Yes...home.
You are well?
"ORRAN I am, thank you."
What news of the war?
"COUNT ORLANDEAU None good, as you know well enough."
"War is a dirty enough affair when you know who your enemies are, but this...ha!"
Would my good name were our only casualty.
ORRAN I should think Duke Goltanna's name in greater peril.
They say his other lords bannermen remain here only because you do.
COUNT ORLANDEAU Leave such foolish talk to fools.
"When a member of House Orlandeau pledges his lord fealty, he honors that oath, though it cost him his life."
ORRAN I'm sorry.
I spoke overmuch.
COUNT ORLANDEAU Words are wind.
"Now, this errand I set you to."
I would hear of it.
"ORRAN The reports are true, my lord."
"The crystal discovered beneath Goug, the Stone the late cardinal found in the ruins of Zeltennia-both auracite for true, by all accounts."
"The Knights Templarate, too, are passing busy, though the object of their labors I cannot say."
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Do our ears in Mullonde hear nothing?155.ORRAN Hear perhaps, but dead men tell no tales."
"If only we had some evidence of the High Confessor's plot, we might use it to compel a peace."
Count Orlandeau produces a Zodiac Stone from under his cloak.
COUNT ORLANDEAU This shall not long remain hidden from their gaze.
And then the storm will be upon us.
EXT.
"FREE CITY OF BERVENIA - DAY Ramza enters the holy city only to be met by a slew of female soldiers, led by a female Knight Templar, MELIADOUL."
"MELIADOUL You slew my brother, and I will have satisfaction of you!"
RAMZA Your brother?
Who are you?
MELIADOUL Do not play games with me!
I am Meliadoul Tengille.
You killed my brother Isilud at Riovanes!
And now you will die!
Not by any order of His Holiness.
I do this for Isilud!
Ramza can neither reason nor coerce this woman.
And another battle ensues.
RAMZA You say Isilud was your brother.
But I am not your brother's killer!
Do you not know what happened at Riovanes?
The murder done there was not done by the hand of any man.
An abomination - a Lucavi killed your brother!
MELIADOUL A Lucavi?
"So the Lucavi again walk among us, killing for their own delight?"
Ha!
A splendid tale!
But a lie less fanciful might better persuade.156.RAMZA They keep the truth from you as they did your brother.
"You are puppets, dancing on strings you can or will not see!"
The Zodiac Stones are much more than holy crystals to be revered.
"They hold real power, the power to work wonders."
"A power in itself neither good nor evil, but the purpose your masters would put it to is plain enough."
"Open your eyes, Meliadoul!"
Let Folmarv deceive you no longer!
MELIADOUL Do you think to convince me with this prattle?
You are a fool indeed!
My father would never deceive me so.
RAMZA Lord Folmarv is your father!?
"Meliadoul fights to her last breath, but refuses to perish in this battle."
MELIADOUL You fight well.
Small wonder Wiegraf fell to you.
"Hear me, Ramza."
"When next we meet, your blood will soak the earth!"
She teleports away and the battle is won.
INT.
"ZELTENNIA CASTLE, RUINS - DAY Delita mourns his sister in silence."
DELITA Tietra...
He hears an odd noise nearby.
"It's Ovelia, attempting to whistle with a blade of grass, just near the fountain."
"DELITA(cont'd) You know that trick, also - making a whistle of a blade of grass?"
He picks up a blade of grass himself.
DELITA(cont'd) Here - like this.157.Delita whistles.
"Ovelia tries and fails, but he shows her once more and she succeeds."
OVELIA I did it!
Delita's pendant flashes and catches Ovelia's eye.
OVELIA(cont'd) A pendant?
"DELITA I keep it as a remembrance of my sister, Tietra."
She...she was caught up in this fighting and died.
OVELIA I'm sorry.
DELITA She died for the nobility's convenience.
"They used her and cast her away, and for that I cannot forgive them."
"Turning to Ovelia, Delita sees his sister's ghost."
DELITA(cont'd) I shall not let them deal to you the same fate they dealt to her.
I will protect you from aught and all who would use you.
OVELIA Delita...Thank you.
INT.
"ZELTENNIA CASTLE, CHURCH - DAY Ramza is in the middle of prayer before a well-lit altar."
Delita enters and strides towards Ramza.
DELITA A heretic at prayer in a church.
"Passing bold, Ramza."
RAMZA head down( ) I shall ask it plain.
Why has the High Confessor planted you amongst Goltanna's men.158.DELITA I see no harm in telling you.
Duke Goltanna and Count Orlandeau.
I am to assassinate them.
Ramza lifts his head in shock as Delita kneels alongside him reaching the altar.
"DELITA(cont'd) faces forward( ) Groups such as the Corpse Brigade, ill-contented with the Crown and the nobility, are in no short supply."
The Church only fans rebellion's flame.
"The people tire of war, and their disdain for the Crown waxes with each passing day."
INSERT A BATTLEFIELD UNDER A BRIGHT SUN.
"HUNDREDS OF MEN AND DOZENS OF FLAGS WAVE ACROSS FORT BESSELAT, WHICH HAS BECOME A TESTING GROUND TO BREAK AN IMPASSE BETWEEN THE ARMIES."
THE SKY BURNS ORANGE WITH WAR'S FLAMES FROM WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE PREAMBLE TO A GRUESOME BATTLE.
"DELITA(cont'd) Of course, Goltanna and Larg want to put down the rebellion at home, only they lack the troops to do so."
"To break the impasse, they seek to bring an end to the conflict for good and all."
"Even as we speak, their armies mass at Fort Besselat to that purpose."
RAMZA Then these months of rebellion and unrest - it all goes as the High Confessor had planned.
DELITA Yes.
But it will not end as they have hoped.
Larg and Goltanna will be assassinated once the battle begins.
"Cut off one head, and two more spring forth, so naturally their closest allies must die with them."
"Count Orlandeau of the Order of the Southern Sky, Zalbaag of the Northern."
"And of course, Lord Dycedarg."
"(MORE)159.With their leaders gone, the fightingDELITA(cont'd) will cease, and they will have no choice but to embrace the peace we offer."
RAMZA A peace?
Or surrender on the Church's terms?
DELITA The people will proffer to the Church the role of mediator with hands upraised.
"What's more, the Church will have the Zodiac Braves."
Delita rises and walks towards the stained-glass window above the altar.
DELITA(cont'd) One thing yet remains between the Church and the auracite.
"The heretic, Ramza Beoulve."
RAMZA disbelief( ) Is that it?
You've come to fetch the auracite for your masters?
DELITA bangs his fist( ) I am no hound heeling at the Church's skirts.
I answer to no one but myself.
RAMZA Meaning what?
"DELITA Meaning I would not think twice of killing you, Ramza, should the hour come."
But not this day.
"Though our methods be different, our goals are not."
"As long as they remain so, you are no enemy of mine."
"Ramza remains kneeling at the foot of the altar, while Delita hovers over him like a regal figure, basking in the sunlight."
Ramza rises as Delita turns to leave.
The two stand back to back with one another.160.RAMZA Delita.
Let us fight this together.
DELITA I cannot join you.
She needs me - far too much to leave her now.
RAMZA The princess?
"DELITA Prince or princess, the Church cares not."
It craves only power.
"A puppet state, with the High Confessor at its strings."
This is their grand plan for Ivalice.
RAMZA turns to Delita( ) And you?
Do you not use Ovelia to fulfill your own ambitions?
DELITA turns away( ) I cannot say.
I am sure only of this.
"To save her life, I would gladly give my own."
You must think this strange.
"RAMZA No, I understand only too well."
"From outside the church, a BOOMING VOICE makes itself known."
"CONFESSOR ZALMOUR (O.S.) I address the heretic, Ramza Beoulve!"
You are besieged!
You will surrender yourself to us at once!
RAMZA I know that voice.
Confessor Zalmour!
Ramza rushes from the church.
Delita follows.
EXT.
"ZELTENNIA CASTLE, CHURCH - DAY Zalmour stands atop the church's bell tower with a number of guards."
He notices Delita alongside Ramza.
CONFESSOR ZALMOUR The Blackram Knights' Delita Heiral?
Yours is an unexpected sight!161.DELITA He has seen me.
He must not live to tell of it!
"We must fight them, Ramza!"
RAMZA They know nothing of the High Confessor's plot.
They serve him blindly.
"If we explain what has happened, they may well listen."
"DELITA Hear your words, Ramza!"
"Reasoning with their ilk is folly, even you must see this."
But you have leave to try!
Ramza and Delita fight against Zalmour and his soldiers.
CONFESSOR ZALMOUR You realize what it is you do?
This man is a heretic!
You that do abet him shall share his fate!
I did not think to find the commander of the Blackram Knights a traitor to our cause!
DELITA My choice is made.
"If it means I must slay each of you to the man, so be it!"
CONFESSOR ZALMOUR You should tremble with fear to mock the Heavens so!
"To slay a man of the cloth is to wound this fair land's peace, and turn your back on the natural order the Father has bestowed on us!"
It is to turn your back on the gods!
DELITA Wound the peace?
Ha!
You hide behind this peace only as it suits you!
You invoke the name of the gods to subjugate the weak.
This peace you hail is a vile farce!
Men such as you profane the gods to speak their names!
The battle rages on.
"Though Ramza attempts to end it with as little bloodshed as possible.162.RAMZA It is not the gods that concern me, but the truth!"
"CONFESSOR ZALMOUR Truth, you say?"
Do you name the charges against you false?
"Our Holy Office offered you a forum in which to clear your name, to absolve yourself of the charges of murder and theft that dog you."
But you discarded this chance like so much night soil.
"You fled, and in so running proved your guilt!"
"You have been tried and found guilty, Ramza Beoulve!"
Your only absolution now is in death!
The hour of your plea comes too late!
RAMZA Then you force my hand!
Zalmour falls against Ramza's blade.
"CONFESSOR ZALMOUR Great Father, strike these sinners, that they...may feel your wrath..."
Post-battle.
Ramza and Delita steer clear of the ensuing commotion.
"DELITA Where will you go now, Ramza?"
RAMZA Two errands brought me to Zeltennia.
The first was to meet with you.
The second is to speak with Count Orlandeau.
DELITA The Thunder God?
RAMZA I mean to enlist his aid in exposing the Church's intrigues.
DELITA How?
RAMZA I have powerful evidence of the Church's misdeeds.163.DELITA The Scriptures of Germonique!
"RAMZA I spoke with the count's adopted son, Orran, not long past."
He pledged their aid should I bring hard evidence against the Church.
"DELITA Orran, eh?"
"A female mage, VALMAFRA, joins them."
DELITA(cont'd) It's all right.
She's with me.
Mullonde has provided several others to help me carry out my task.
She is but one.
VALMAFRA Help you?
I was sent to keep watch on you.
DELITA And a fine job you're doing of it.
Only she knows our plans in full.
I trust no other in Goltanna's army more.
"VALMAFRA You're the youngest Beoulve, Ramza, am I right?"
My name is Valmafra.
DELITA I take it you did not come for idle chat?
VALMAFRA The Northern Order moves.
DELITA They make for Besselat?
VALMAFRA Count Orlandeau himself has departed for the same only just now.
Duke Goltanna is like to join them soon.
"At the head of your Blackram Knights, no less.164.DELITA Then we're too late."
The fighting will continue.
RAMZA Do not give up yet.
I might still convince the count to avoid this needless bloodshed.
DELITA Then our paths part once again.
"RAMZA Be safe, Delita."
"DELITA And you, Ramza."
Delita steps towards Ramza and the two shake hands.
Ramza departs.
VALMAFRA You mean to let him go?
DELITA He acts as I expected he would.
VALMAFRA Even your friends are only pieces to be played.
DELITA Mind your words!
You know not what you say!
VALMAFRA shrugs() Such outbursts ill become a man.
DELITA Haven't you somewhere else to be?
The church bell tolls as she leaves.
EXT.
"BEDDHA SANDWASTE - DAY Along the way to Fort Besselat, Ramza is met by BARICH, a Machinist in Templarate attire, with a long scar down the side of his face."
He plots at something vile.165.BARICH That's the last of it.
The winds bear it onward now.
And fair winds they are.
They should keep it airborne for a half-day if they hold - more than time enough.
Ramza appears in time to catch wind of Barich's plans.
BARICH(cont'd) Now there is a creature I had not thought to find in these wastes!
RAMZA One might say the same of a Knight Templar so far from the Church.
What is it you scatter to the wind?
"BARICH Oh, that?"
I suppose there's no harm in your knowing.
There's naught you can do to stop it now.
RAMZA Stop what!?
BARICH This.
Barich pulls a leather satchel from his robe and lobs it at Ramza.
The satchel explodes into a cloud of green dust.
Ramza falls to his knees coughing.
RAMZA Poison!
BARICH Yes.
Ground into a fine powder and cast upon the winds toward the Northern Sky.
"The toxin will not kill the men who breathe it - but it will wither their constitution, rendering them unable to fight."
RAMZA But why?
The High Confessor stands to gain naught by handing victory to Goltanna!166.BARICH Nor does he think to.
"The moment Goltanna hears of the Northern Order's plight, he will send his armies against them."
"With his own stronghold unguarded, Goltanna will be an easy target for assassination, and Count Orlandeau with him."
But do not think Duke Larg will escape this scourge - his is the easy death to achieve.
"Amidst the coming chaos, who could say how Duke Larg might meet his end?"
RAMZA You're inhuman!
BARICH You ought rejoice!
This will mean an end to war and bloodshed.
"And with that end, a new beginning."
The Church's hand shall rule.
Such is the will of the people.
They clamor for change - an end to groveling at highborn heels.
"RAMZA The war will end, but not like this."
There is another way!
BARICH I expected you'd say as much - no matter!
Barich launches an assault against Ramza using a gun infused with magicks.
"BARICH(cont'd) Once you've put a stop to this fighting, what then?"
How do you propose to purge Ivalice of her corruption?
Her fever will not cease to rage till her festered limbs are cut and seared!
Even you must see that now!
RAMZA You would cut away the pure flesh with the foul.
"There is corruption, yes, but there are also good men in Ivalice, and they are not few!"
(MORE)167.There are ways to heal a festeredRAMZA(cont'd) wound without the knife.
The poison can be drawn!
BARICH Pray tell what poultice might draw the nobles from this land!
"So long as you blight it with your existence, we must bow to your whims."
A man alone might know equality.
"Two men, never!"
One will ever seek to exploit the other.
And I will not be exploited!
"I will claim your seat, and take what is my due."
I should think I have at least that right!
RAMZA You think to cure the realm's corruption by becoming part of it?
What then when another comes to claim your seat?
You care not for Ivalice's suffering - you care only for your own!
BARICH Such righteous words!
More the greater your hypocrisy!
Ramza mortally wounds Barich.
BARICH(cont'd) No!
I was not...not to die like this...
He perishes.
Ramza looks onward to Fort Besselat.
RAMZA Gods give us haste.
INT.
FORT BESSELAT - DAY Count Orlandeau finds himself surrounded by a host of Goltanna's guards.
"COUNT ORLANDEAU I, plotting against the duke?"
Are you mad?
"SOUTHERN SKY KNIGHT Please, my lord."
Do not make this harder than it must be.
We have our orders.168.COUNT ORLANDEAU Why in the name of all that's good would I wish to unseat my liege lord?
Goltanna enters and the knights kneel.
DUKE GOLTANNA You ask the very question that vexes me.
"I am gravely disappointed in you, Cid."
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Surely you cannot mean that, Your Grace!"
I am no turncloak!
I am your most loyal man!
DUKE GOLTANNA The proof speaks otherwise.
"It seems you have been in league with members of the Church, working secretly to see me ousted from my rightful seat."
COUNT ORLANDEAU That is absurd!
From what lying blackguard did you hear such reverie!?
DUKE GOLTANNA Even yet you deny it?
My information comes from the High Confessor himself.
You can imagine his distress upon learning of the plot.
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Your Grace, the High Confessor deceives you!"
It is he who schemes in the shadows!
DUKE GOLTANNA The High Confessor?
Now there is an august claim!
Have you any evidence of this?
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Twenty and more years of loyal service, and still you require evidence?"
"Words fail me, Your Grace."
DUKE GOLTANNA As you fail me.
I cannot hope to fight a war without your Order's forces.
"(MORE)169.Still, it seems I am left no choice.DUKE GOLTANNA (cont'd) A lamentable situation for us both."
Take him from my sight!
The knights rise and escort a bound Orlandeau out of the room.
Delita then enters alongside Valmafra.
Both kneel.
"DELITA You summoned, Your Grace?"
DUKE GOLTANNA I want you to maintain your contact with Mullonde.
"Once the Confessional rescript is in my hands, Larg is as good as defeated."
"DELITA Fear not, Your Grace."
The High Confessor's mind is most firm on that account.
DUKE GOLTANNA Hmm.
He had seemed somewhat indifferent to me.
There is another matter as well.
I am placing the Order of the Southern Sky under your leadership.
"Henceforth, you are a Knight Devout."
DELITA You grant me honor far beyond my due.
DUKE GOLTANNA I expect I shall not regret it.
"I place my full and utter confidence in you, Delita - you, and you alone."
DELITA Your Grace.

"FORT BESSELAT, SOUTHERN GATES - DAY Ramza enters the fort from the south, determined to stop the eventual outbreak of war."
SOUTHERN SKY SENTRY Who are you?
How did you breach the fortress?170.RAMZA We are not of the Northern Sky!
We come under white banner to meet with Count Orlandeau.
We must see him at once!
"SOUTHERN SKY SENTRY So, the count has visitors!"
I wager you're the rabble he found to assassinate the duke.
You fools!
We hold Orlandeau in a cell behind these very walls!
Not to worry.
There's room enough in the dungeons for you and the count both!
Ramza quickly silences the sentries.
He scans the distance where two armies are preparing to collide - a war seems both imminent and inevitable.
RAMZA We must act quickly if we are to stop this battle!
EXT.
"FORT BESSELAT, BATTLEFIELD - DAY On the opposite side of Fort Besselat, the Order of the Northern Sky has taken a heavy blow."
Zalbaag arrives to find poisoned bodies scattered about.
ZALBAAG What's happened here?
He finds a barely conscious female knight struggling to stand.
ZALBAAG (cont'd) You are unwell.
What's wrong?
NORTHERN SKY KNIGHT coughing( ) It is only my...my head.
I'll be...
fine.
She collapses.
ZALBAAG Can you hear me?
What ill magick is this?171.DYCEDARG (O.S.) They have befouled the air.
A poison extracted from mossfungus spores.
Dycedarg appears from behind as he falls likewise to his knees.
Zalbaag braces him.
ZALBAAG Lord Brother!
DYCEDARG holds his head( ) I will be well.
I worry only for the duke.
Where is he?
ZALBAAG Would that I knew.
My search has yielded naught.
DUKE LARG from above( ) Zalbaag...Dycedarg.
I am here.
"Duke Larg lies in a corner atop a parapet, coughing and ailing."
The two Beoulve brothers rush to his aid.
"ZALBAAG Excellency, are you harmed?"
Someone!
Summon an apothecary at once!
"DYCEDARG How do you feel, Your Excellency?"
DUKE LARG My head...it is as though it were split in twain.
But I do not think it serious.
I just need...some time.
DYCEDARG Most unfortunate.
DUKE LARG What?
Dycedarg draws a dagger and deftly stabs Duke Larg in the chest.
DUKE LARG (cont'd) Urgh...What...have you done?
"ZALBAAG Dycedarg!?172.DYCEDARG twists the knife( deeper) Be silent, Brother!"
DUKE LARG You...you've betrayed me?
You killed your father to...to gain control of your house.
And now you have killed me.
"Dycedarg draws back, panting heavily."
Duke Larg collapses and dies.
ZALBAAG Is this poison your work as well?
DYCEDARG No...No.
It is a gift from those who would see House Beoulve take center stage.
ZALBAAG Why do this?
DYCEDARG Duke Larg was slain in battle.
It is now left to House Beoulve to carry out his wishes.
ZALBAAG This...you go too far.
DYCEDARG This dagger.
Place it among the corpses.
They were assassins.
Sent by the Southern Order.
You understand me...yes?
Dycedarg collapses as well from illness.
ZALBAAG Dycedarg!?
EXT.
"FORT BESSELAT, SLUICE - DAY Back on the other side of the Fort, Ramza approaches the garrison's floodgates."
He hatches a plan.173.RAMZA Of course!
The sluice!
"With the sluice open, the lake's waters will flood everything downstream."
Battle will be impossible.
He fights through Southern Order troops to open the sluice.
He succeeds.
"And the water gushes forth, quickly flooding the surrounding land."
INT.
"FORT BESSELAT, DUNGEON - DAY Orran, Valmafra and Ramza enter the dungeon where Count Orlandeau is held."
"ORRAN Count Orlandeau, we've come!"
"I pray you've been kept well, my lord."
Ramza and Valmafra kneel.
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Well enough, as you can see."
And this must be Ramza.
"How you've grown, boy!"
"Still, I recognized you at once."
"RAMZA Have we met, Excellency?"
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Yes, though I can't say I'm surprised you've forgotten."
You were only a child of some three or four years at the time.
"You gave us all quite a fright, trying to lift my sword."
"Your father gave you a scolding that left you in tears, but at least you weren't hurt."
Ha ha ha.
And now here you've come to rescue me.
I thank you.
There's no need to kneel.
They rise.
"ORRAN The battle is ended, with only light casualties on either side."
"This, too, thanks to the help of Ramza and his companions."
"We've managed to hold the fires of war at bay, for a time.174.COUNT ORLANDEAU I see."
"You are a worthy son of Barbaneth, young Ramza."
"There are many who owe you their thanks, and I give it now in their stead."
"And mine with it, to be sure."
RAMZA I do only what must needs be done.
COUNT ORLANDEAU I see your likeness to Barbaneth is more than skin deep.
"Your deeds honor him, boy."
VALMAFRA Pray forgive my interruption.
But Duke Goltanna means to execute Your Excellency on the morrow.
We should waste no time in fleeing.
"ORRAN It is as she says, my lord."
We should continue this elsewhere.
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Yes, yes."
It won't do for me to remain here with Goltanna in this ill temper.
"Orran, the hour of this war's end will not be long in coming."
"Until it does, I mean to travel with Ramza."
We must put a stop to the High Confessor's plans.
"ORRAN Then I will go with you, my lord!"
COUNT ORLANDEAU No.
You will return to Zeltennia and see to the safety of Lady Ovelia.
She alone is the rightful heir to the throne.
You must see that she comes to no harm.
ORRAN I understand.
"COUNT ORLANDEAU Well, Ramza, you've no objections, I trust?"
"RAMZA None at all, my lord.175.COUNT ORLANDEAU Then let's away before we're found."
INT.
"FORT BESSELAT - DAY Looking from the window, Duke Goltanna contemplates the current dire circumstances."
DUKE GOLTANNA How has the sluice been opened?
I suffer a plague of fools!
Delita enters and kneels.
"DELITA You called for me, Excellency."
DUKE GOLTANNA You are to gather a company of soldiers and move against the Northern Sky at once!
"DELITA The water from the sluice makes movement difficult enough, let alone fighting."
DUKE GOLTANNA What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
This is an opportunity we cannot let pass!
They will not be expecting an attack.
"If they slip away now, who can say how long this war may drag on?"
DELITA I must refuse.
DUKE GOLTANNA Refuse!?
Delita quickly draws his sword and lunges it into Goltanna's chest.
DUKE GOLTANNA (cont'd) How...how dare you?
DELITA No man would wish to see you king!
Blood gushes forth as Delita withdraws his blade.176.Duke Goltanna falls dead to the floor in an instant.
DELITA(cont'd) towards the door( ) Come!
Valmafra and a man dressed as Count Orlandeau enter.
"The Orlandeau doppleganger, a devout member of the Church, kneels before Delita."
DELITA(cont'd) Know that your death is not in vain.
"GLABADOS DEVOUT The vanity would be in living, when Saint Ajora calls me to His side."
Delita swiftly executes the man.
VALMAFRA The real Count Orlandeau has escaped with Ramza.
DELITA Then we can but hope that Ramza does not fail us.
EXT.
"FORT BESSELAT, BATTLEFIELD - DAY A completely flooded Fort Besselat holds the two armies' dwindling front lines at bay."
"Ramza narrates: ""High Confessor Marcel came forward with his offer to mediate a peace between the camps, but though their leaders had been lost, their capacity to make war had not."
The High Confessor's offer fell on deaf ears.
I made for Limberry.
"For Alma..."" INT."
"EAGROSE CASTLE, SOLAR - DAY The Knight Templar, Loffrey, sits down with Dycedarg."
"A fire is lit nearby, and one of the doors is slightly ajar."
"LOFFREY So, you are unwilling to compromise on your position.177.DYCEDARG Ivalice's reunification under its rightful king was His Grace's most fervent wish."
We've no intention of laying down arms until Prince Orinus sits the throne that is his birthright.
You will not steer the helm of Ivalice at your own pleasure.
Not so long as this house stands.
LOFFREY Do you not know who made your assassination of the duke possible?
DYCEDARG I mislike the question.
Larg was felled by a Southern Sky assassin.
Or do you mean to say that you were the ones who sent him?
LOFFREY I'll not play at this fool's game.
"There is to be no convincing you, then?"
"DYCEDARG Were it our desire, we could crush the Templarate like an overripe grape."
Of that I am quite convinced.
LOFFREY Pray remove that fine white cloak beforehand.
Burst grapes oft leave a fearsome stain.
"Tell me, this poison employed at Besselat - do you know what it was?"
After a moment of silence- DYCEDARG I believe it was an extract of mossfungus spores.
LOFFREY So it was.
"An insidious thing, mossfungus."
"It takes a great quantity to kill a man, but the toxin never leaves the blood."
"The smallest, most undetectable of doses will prove lethal, if repeated oft enough."
Dycedarg remains quiet.178.LOFFREY (cont'd) Even a learned eye might confuse the symptoms with those of common affliction.
"Oft as not, the person being poisoned is never even aware."
"And should they become so, it is almost invariably too late."
"Your late lord father was taken by malady, was he not?"
DYCEDARG Do you make some implication?
LOFFREY I'm told you yourself have some knowledge in poisoncraft.
DYCEDARG What of it?
LOFFREY I recently learned an interesting fact.
I had wondered if you might be aware of it.
Mossfungus poisoning leaves spores in the body.
"When a victim is buried, they say toadstools sprout above the grave."
"Dycedarg goes quiet again, longer than before."
"LOFFREY (cont'd) Forgive me, I digress."
"Ah, yes, there was another matter - a gift from High Confessor Marcel."
Loffrey pulls out Zodiac Stone from his doublet.
It glimmers as it's set upon the table.
DYCEDARG A gemstone?
LOFFREY It is a Zodiac Stone - a blessed crystal from Mullonde.
The High Confessor wished for you to have it.
Please accept it as a symbol of the Church's good faith.
Its glimmer catches a figure in the hallway just outside the door.
Zalbaag has been eavesdropping the entire time.179.EXT.
"LIMBERRY CASTLE, GATES - DAY Ramza reaches the gates of Limberry Castle."
"He walks cautiously towards the entrance, but sees no one."
RAMZA Not a soul to be found.
Could the castle truly be abandoned?
The door stands open...
A strange premonition returns.
RAMZA(cont'd) I mislike this.
There is something familiar - yes.
The battle with Cuchulainn and Belias...
"Celia, one of Elmdore's assassins, makes her presence known."
CELIA Guests!
Guests come to Limberry!
I'd begun to think you'd never arrive.
Lettie also appears from another height of the gate.
LETTIE Such a waste that would have been.
We've such a warm welcome planned.
"A kiss, to see you to your grave."
A number of disfigured horned beats join the women and surround Ramza.
RAMZA We've walked into a trap!
Ramza slays the beasts and fends off the female assassins.
"CELIA If you would see your sister again, you must fight your way to her!"
LETTIE I await within.
But I've so little patience...Best be quick!
The two teleport away.
"RAMZA I am coming, Alma!180.INT."
"LIMBERRY CASTLE, CHAMBER - DAY Marquis Elmdore and Folmarv sit inside Elmdore's chamber at a table."
MARQUIS ELMDORE Belias and Cuchulainn...defeated.
"We are all that's left - we and Adrammelech, who waits trapped in the Rift."
FOLMARV Do not worry over Adrammelech.
He will join us ere long.
MARQUIS ELMDORE You've found a host?
FOLMARV Not I.
The Stone.
"The Stone chooses the flesh, as it was with us."
MARQUIS ELMDORE Of course.
Then all that remains is the revival of the master.
"Once that is done, we will have no need of auracite - nor of these vessels."
We will come and go as we please.
Do we have a host for the High Seraph?
Do not tell me it is that girl.
FOLMARV There is but one host fit for the High Seraph.
The girl is the chosen.
"Now we need only find the way to the necrohol, and the High Seraph's soul."
"Celia and Lettie teleport into the chamber, kneeling."
CELIA He is here.
LETTIE I've drawn him into our web.
What would you now have me do with him?
"MARQUIS ELMDORE Ah, Ramza."
So long you kept us waiting.
We have a score to settle from Riovanes.181.FOLMARV Do not take light of him.
He is a worthy foe.
Not even Belias could stand before him.
MARQUIS ELMDORE You needn't worry about me.
I shall deal with him.
You've matters of far greater import.
You must find the gate to the necrohol.
FOLMARV Be at ease.
I will not disappoint you.
Folmarv rises and teleports away.
MARQUIS ELMDORE See that you don't.
Now fly!
INT.
"LIMBERRY CASTLE, HALLWAY - DAY Ramza reaches the hall of Limberry where marquis Elmdore and his assassins await."
"MARQUIS ELMDORE At last, the hour of my retribution is come."
RAMZA Where do you hide my sister!?
"MARQUIS ELMDORE Questions are the right of the victor, Ramza - not that of a man about to meet his end!"
Ramza is again forced to fight a man whose life he once saved.
"During this battle, Celia and Lettie also transform into monstrous beasts, both of whom Ramza also kill."
MARQUIS ELMDORE (cont'd) You are strong.
There...there is no denying that.
It is more than I can overcome...so bound within this fragile shell of flesh.
Marquis Elmdore teleports away.182.MARQUIS ELMDORE (O.S.) I await you in the undercroft.
It is there your darling sister sleeps.
RAMZA You will not escape me!
A familiar voice stops him.
MAN'S VOICE You'll not enter the undercroft on my watch.
The way is shut.
RAMZA Who speaks?
Reveal yourself!
"MAN'S VOICE Naive as ever, I see."
Argath teleports into plain sight - now a ghostly version of his former self.
ARGATH Ha!
To think my luck so fair that we would chance to meet again!
RAMZA Argath!
How did - I thought you for dead!
ARGATH Dead?
Oh...Ramza...Your mind's as common as your friends!
"I did not die, I was reborn!"
Chosen by a greater power!
"I did not fall before, nor shall I here."
That fate belongs to you!
Ramza fights his former friend turned foe once again for the last time.
"RAMZA So, your soul is bartered as well."
Your grandsire would be proud.
ARGATH How dare you!
"You, pampered and coddled from your earliest days!"
What do you know of our affairs?
"Of being made to toil for another's pleasure, near without reward?"
"(MORE)183.Being tred upon even by peasantARGATH(cont'd) filth, struggling endlessly to rise back to your feet - what do you know of this?"
I'll purge this kingdom of all who once dared look down on me!
There is no place in the world for the meager!
RAMZA You'll do nothing of the sort!
ARGATH How do you intend to stop me?
You who cannot even defend his own sister?
"A son of House Beoulve, and meek as a butterfly all the same!"
Ha ha ha!
RAMZA Guard your tongue!
"ARGATH Worry not, I'll soon send your dear sister beyond the veil to be with you!"
Just as I did Delita's!
"Argath, despite his best efforts, falls to Ramza a second time."
ARGATH(cont'd) M-Mother...Help...me...
"RAMZA I'm on my way, Alma!"
INT.
"LIMBERRY CASTLE, UNDERCROFT - DAY Marquis Elmdore awaits in meditation for Ramza amongst bony corpses and stone coffins."
RAMZA Elmdore!
You fight a battle already lost!
"Release Alma, and end this vain struggle!"
MARQUIS ELMDORE How could I release what I have never held?
There are but ghosts within these walls.
Ghostly Knights and skeletal creatures arise from their tombs.184.MARQUIS ELMDORE (cont'd) But far be it from me to turn away the one Beoulve to grace us with his presence!
"A magenta light engulfs him similar to Wiegraf and Delacroix, turning him into a Lucavi."
"He is the winged beast, Zalera, the Death Seraph."
"ZALERA THE DEATH SERAPH Here dying, join my legion of undeath."
"Your blood, the roses on unhallow'd graves!"
Meliadoul enters the undercroft just in time to see the transformation.
MELIADOUL The marquis is made a demon!?
What devilry is this?
Zalera unleashes its magickal attacks against both Ramza and Meliadoul.
MELIADOUL (cont'd) This...this is the work of the auracite?
RAMZA Do you now believe me?
"Your brother Isilud learned this foul truth, and died fighting it!"
MELIADOUL You...you speak true?
"My father, Folmarv - does he know of this?"
RAMZA I...I tried to- ZALERA THE DEATH SERAPH cackles( ) Before me stands the seed of Folmarv's loins?
"So much alike with brother Isilud, both heirs of father's numen unpossess'd."
"The sire's flesh, a vessel without flaw!"
MELIADOUL My father is host to a demon!?185.ZALERA THE DEATH SERAPH Truth dawns within this child's naivety.
"Who once was hers, now kin to naught but woe."
Let not such trifles weigh upon you now.
Ere long you shall know darkness deeper still!
"Ramza and Meliadoul fight off the Death Seraph together, shoulder-to-shoulder."
"MELIADOUL Forgive me, Ramza."
I took your words as false.
I thought you for an enemy.
RAMZA I might have done the same in your place.
But now let us avenge your brother's death!
Zalera is no match for Ramza and Meliadoul's combined strength.
ZALERA THE DEATH SERAPH Hashmal...bring order here...where I have failed.
"Zalera disintegrates in the same magenta light, leaving nothing but the Stone behind."
Post-battle.
"Meliadoul speaks with Ramza, holding the Stone in her hand."
MELIADOUL My mind reels to think such evil power lay concealed within this tiny crystal.
These holy relics of the Church...I'd thought them no more than strangely colored stones.
I knew not that they sought to work true miracles through them.
The stone glimmers.
"RAMZA The truth was kept well guarded, from you and Isilud alike."
Even Wiegraf knew naught of their true nature until he became a Lucavi.
It is as I thought.
Lord Folmarv guides even the High Confessor's scheming to their ends.186.MELIADOUL What is it they wish?
RAMZA I cannot see their ends.
"If we are to judge from Riovanes, they posses power enough already to drive an army to its knees."
"Yet still they do not use it, or even flaunt it openly."
"There must be a reason, and that reason is our answer."
MELIADOUL Surely they stay their hands for something.
"The Lucavi are cruel and wicked, and cannot be felled by men."
Every tale and legend paints them the same.
RAMZA So they do.
But I have seen these monsters slain.
They do not appear to be the undying demons of which the legends speak.
"MELIADOUL Legends are but stories, embellished with each new telling."
Mayhap the Lucavi are no more than ordinary fiends.
RAMZA Let us pray that you are right.
Meliadoul passes the Stone over to Ramza.
MELIADOUL I trust the auracite to you.
But I ask a favor in return.
Take me with you.
I must know what made my father as he is.
And...there is another thing I would know as well.
RAMZA What is that?
MELIADOUL My father did a puzzling thing.
He gifted the Capricorn Stone to Lord Dycedarg.
But I cannot begin to fathom why.187.RAMZA He gave a Zodiac Stone to my brother?

He couldn't have run far!
Orran tumbles into the room.
"Injured, he closes the door behind him and kneels."
OVELIA Orran!
What's happened!?
You're bleeding!
ORRAN Lady Ovelia...there is something...
something I must tell you...
OVELIA You mustn't speak!
ORRAN I beg you...hear my words.
The man who murdered Duke Goltanna was not...
"not my father, Count Orlandeau."
"My father, he...he was framed for treason."
He escaped from Fort Besselat with...Ramza Beoulve.
He fights now to frustrate the High Confessor's plot.
OVELIA I did not think the count a man who would plot at rebellion.
GUARDSMAN #1 from outside( ) The door won't open!
GUARDSMAN #2 Lady Ovelia!
"Are you safe?188.GUARDSMAN #1 Please open the door, my lady!"
"OVELIA to Orran( ) But if not your father, then who?"
ORRAN It- Guards break down the door and rush in.
"GUARDSMAN #1 Princess, has he harmed you!?"
GUARDSMAN #2 We found him!
He's in here!
"Delita enters, wearing a noble robe."
The guards kneel before him.
DELITA Leave us.
GUARDSMAN #1 My lord?
"DELITA Stand up, turn, and walk out the door behind you!"
"GUARDSMAN #1 B-but, Lord Commander-!"
DELITA It was not a request.
"GUARDSMAN #1 As...as you command, my lord."
The two guards leave.
Delita walks to Orran as Valmafra enters behind him.
"OVELIA I beg you, hurt him no further!"
"DELITA This is a foolish thing you've done, Orran."
ORRAN Traitor...You have no right to speak to me.189.DELITA You act as though you did not wish for what I did.
Look around you.
Do you see any earnest tears?
You were not alone in praying for his fall.
I even made your father out for dead.
You should thank me.
No one pursues a man known slain.
ORRAN I am in no mood for japes!
"OVELIA Why would you do such a thing, Delita?"
"DELITA I told you, didn't I?"
I work to see you made a queen for true.
OVELIA Naught you do is for true!
You wish only to use me like the rest!
DELITA You do not trust me?
She doesn't know how to answer.
"DELITA(cont'd) You trust me or you don't, Ovelia."
Which is it?
OVELIA I...I want to trust you.
I do.
But...
it is not such an easy thing.
DELITA Return to your chambers.
I need have words with Orran.
"OVELIA Please, do not hurt him."
DELITA I won't.
You have my word.
"Ovelia walks off and opens the door to her room, leaving it ajar enough to eavesdrop on their conversation."
ORRAN What I meant to do is done.
I only sought to clear my father's name.

I only ask you make it cleanORRAN(cont'd) and quick.
DELITA Stop your whimpering.
I do not mean to kill you.
That would be a waste.
ORRAN What use could you possibly see in me?
DELITA Your loyal service.
ORRAN Ha!
Again you jape!
I would die before I bent my knee in your service!
DELITA No.
"No, you would not."
I am going to bring down the Northern Sky.
"And when that Sky falls, the land of Ivalice will again be made level."
Then I build a new kingdom for Ovelia.
"The High Confessor will face judgment as well, of course."
I am not the Church's hound.
Both Orran and Valmafra turn sharply to Delita.
ORRAN Are you mad?
DELITA You know what I do is right.
It is undeniably so.
"A commonborn squire takes the reins of a knightly order, and leads a wayward kingdom from the midst of chaos."
The masses yearn for a hero.
I give them what they wish.
ORRAN Using aught and all to forge your legend?
DELITA Is that so wrong?
Ovelia gasps over what she's heard.
"Valmafra, similarly shocked, draws a knife, preparing to advance on Delita.191.DELITA(cont'd) What?"
Do you mean to kill me?
I know full well the High Confessor sent you to keep watch on me.
"Your orders are to kill me at the first sign of betrayal, no?"
"He walks around Orran to face Valmafra, her dagger still drawn."
"DELITA(cont'd) Do it, then."
Stab me with that dagger.

ZALBAAG Lord Father...I need you to take a look at something over here.
He plucks something growing off the side of the grave and tosses it to the herbalist.
ZALBAAG (cont'd) Catch.
Can you tell me the name of that mushroom?192.HERBALIST inspects it( ) Of course.
"It's mossfungus, my lord."
"Not the deadliest of poisons, but not something you'd want in your stew, either."
The stuff gets you in the end.

Zalbaag lowers his head in the direction of the grave.
The herbalist tosses the mushroom into the water.
"HERBALIST I, uh - do you not think we should be getting back now, my lord?"
ZALBAAG What has you so terrified?
"HERBALIST Don't you know, my lord?"
Mossfungus grows only on corpses.
"And, well - they say it's a right bad omen to find it growing on a family grave."
The house falls as the cap rises...or so they say.
"ZALBAAG On your way, then."
He tosses a gold coin to the herbalist HERBALIST Heh.
"Kind thanks, my lord."

"Think, Brother."
"He was a weak man, who relied on others to fight where he could not."

Dycedarg enkindled this war and slew the duke.
All to feed his own ambition.
"He has sullied our name, brought scorn upon our house - he must be made to pay!"
"RAMZA He shall, Lord Brother!"
Blades clash.
Dycedarg grows increasingly frustrated.
DYCEDARG You fools!
Why will you not follow where I lead?
Why do you turn against me?
The powerful must rule the weak!
It is our duty!
"The Crown once held such power, but no more!"
See how fate has brought it low?
Why should we not rule in its stead?
We must wield our power and seize the reins of Ivalice!
Why will you not see this?
"ZALBAAG You feast on power, Brother, but leave no place at the table for justice."
The name Beoulve befits brave men who raise their swords in justice's name.
You are no Beoulve!195.DYCEDARG Justice?
I'd die of shame to hear the word from my own lips!
Such lofty ideals cannot rule a people so common.
Who has earned you the right to wield your sword of justice?
To be hailed as hero?
Is it not I?
"I, who have dirtied my hands to keep yours clean?"
All that you are you owe to me!
"You ought be on your knees thanking me, yet here you stand in judgment!"
Zalbaag lands a killing blow on Dycedarg.
DYCEDARG (cont'd) You've ruined...everything.
Ivalice was to be...to be ours.
You fools...
what have you done?
"The Capricorn Stone on Dycedarg's person emits an emerald aura and Dycedarg transforms into Adrammelech, the Wroth."
ADRAMMELECH THE WROTH So this is what it is to be a god.
to Zalbaag( ) Fool of a brother!
"Heed well these words, the last your ears shall hear."
"Slain by my hand, our father, Barbaneth."
This war had brought our house its chance to rule.
He would but watch as hist'ry passed us by.
"His due I granted him, no more, no less."
No sword yet wrought can parry poison's kiss.
Adrammelech unleashes a powerful pillar of light that teleports Zalbaag from the battlefield.
"ADRAMMELECH THE WROTH (cont'd) And so on you, Ramza, my gaze alights."
"Now know regret, a traitor's recompense!"
Ramza slays his brother who has become a Lucavi.
ADRAMMELECH THE WROTH (cont'd) Too soon this mortal coil did I assume!
"Angel of Blood, High Seraph...come too late."
"Adrammelech disintegrates, leaving behind the Stone.196.RAMZA House Beoulve is no more."
But what does it matter?
"We are the sum of our deeds, not our names."
"Alma...I will find you, Alma."
INT.
"MULLONDE, HOLY OFFICE OF INQUISITION - DAY Dead priests cover the ground."
"Loffrey, Folmarv and a Templarate Mage, CLETIENNE, are assaulting HIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL."
It is Folmarv that delivers a sword strike to the High Confessor's stomach.
HIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL I did not...think you capable of such treachery.
Folmarv withdraws his blade and blood spews forth.
The High Confessor falls to his knees.
FOLMARV Had you made your confession willingly your life might have been spared.
"I should have preferred to employ measures less...extreme, but there's no time for that now."
HIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL I don't...understand.
FOLMARV I had hoped to enlist your aid in gathering the auracite.
But the boy holds most of the Stones now.
Your aid is no longer required.
HIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL Help me...please...
"FOLMARV Your wound is deep, but it is not mortal."
"Treated soon, you will live."
But you must earn your life.
Tell me: Where is the entrance to the necrohol?
HIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL Orbonne.
The vaults beneath the monastery.
"(MORE)197.In the lowest levels, there is aHIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL (cont'd) glyph bound by a magicked seal."
FOLMARV And how does one break this seal?
HIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL I know not.
The Scriptures may hold some clue...I cannot say.
"FOLMARV At every turn, the boy!"
"Folmarv gestures at Loffrey, who takes a closer step."
"FOLMARV (cont'd) Good-bye, Funebris."
Folmarv and Cletienne leave.
HIGH CONFESSOR MARCEL Do not...leave me like this.
I beg you...
"Loffrey hefts his blade and thrusts it into the High Confessor's back, then follows Folmarv out."
EXT.
"MULLONDE - DAY Just outside the Cathedral, Ramza parries against the church's guards."
GLABADOS MAGE Halt!
None save members of the clergy are permitted within these walls!
"State your name and title, and let your purpose in coming here be known!"
RAMZA My name is Ramza Beoulve!
"I petition the release of Alma Beoulve, whose person is held unlawfully by the lord commander of the Knights Templar!"
GLABADOS MAGE Ramza Beoulve!?
You are fool enough to present yourself before us?
We will carry out your sentence where you stand!
"Ramza defeats the Glabados church's host of knights and mages.198.RAMZA Be strong, Alma!"
It will not be long now!
He enters the cathedral.
INT.
"MULLONDE, CATHEDRAL - DAY Ramza and Meliadoul enter a hallway where Folmarv, Loffrey and Cletienne await him."
"FOLMARV Ramza, at last we meet!"
Pray forgive me.
"I ought to have called upon you sooner, but I have been ever so busy of late."
"I fear I remain so even now, so let us make this brief."
"If you would see your sister returned alive, you will relinquish the Scriptures and all the auracite you possess."
"Refuse, and she dies ere the word leaves your lips."
Are we of an understanding?
My patiences is grown thin.
RAMZA I have what you desire.
Where is Alma?
I surrender naught until she is brought before me.
FOLMARV Did you not hear a word I said?
I offered no negotiable terms.
"Forfeit the Scriptures and the Stones, or forfeit your sister's life."
"Ramza takes a measured step forward, and produces the Scriptures of Germonique."
RAMZA Here are the Scriptures.
The Stones I hold until I see that she is safe.
He sets the book to the ground.
Loffrey picks it up and leafs through it.
FOLMARV Well...?199.LOFFREY ...It is written here.
A surprisingly simple incantation.
He closes the book and places it in his robes.
FOLMARV Excellent.
Then we have all we need of them.
"Of course, I suppose propriety dictates that we avenge Belias and the others while they're here."
RAMZA We are deceived!
Ramza parries their attack.
RAMZA(cont'd) Why did you not kill Alma?
FOLMARV What do you mean?
RAMZA You took no pause in slaughtering your own son.
Why keep my sister alive?
FOLMARV Our affairs are not for you to know!
"In the midst of battle, Meliadoul shares some choice words with her father as she's forced to draw her blade on him."
MELIADOUL Are you truly the father I've always known?
"FOLMARV Of course I am, child!"
Why do you fight on their side?
When did you turn against your own kin?
MELIADOUL When my own kin ceased to be the man he once was.
FOLMARV Whatever do you mean?200.MELIADOUL The marquis Elmdore de Limberry was made some sort of fiend when he used a Zodiac Stone.
"And at Riovanes - the monster who killed Isilud and all the others was you, wasn't it?"
FOLMARV Monster?
You think us monsters!?
MELIADOUL Then it's true!
You are not my father.
Meliadoul lands a crushing blow that sends Folmarv to his knees.
FOLMARV Hmph.
We will serve our vengeance another day.
The three Templarates teleport away.
RAMZA They are even more craven than I'd thought!
INT.
"MULLONDE, UNDERCROFT - DAY Ramza pursues Folmarv into a holy burial site beneath Mullonde."
FOLMARV I fear I've no more time to waste on you.
"Would that I could bid you farewell here, but I suspect you'd not part ways so easily."
I suppose you must be returned to the Father after all.
My thralls will delight to guide you to His keeping.
This sanctuary even holds a sarcophagus.
It's as though Fate lends her hand!
Folmarv uses his Zodiac stone to summon a slew of beasts.
"FOLMARV (cont'd) Of course, death is sooner served by steel."
I shall let this one be your foeman as well.
"A pillar of light summons Zalbaag, made undead just as Argath was through arcane magick.201.RAMZA Zalbaag!"
"FOLMARV Once he was your brother, but he is reborn unto us now."
You're a heretic already.
Why not a kinslayer?
Folmarv teleports away.
RAMZA Ever the coward!
FOLMARV (O.S.) Zalbaag!
Deliver me the head of that young man before you!
He must not leave this cathedral alive!
Ramza is forced to fight his brother to save his own life.
"RAMZA Lord Brother, it is I!"
Do you not know your own blood?
ZALBAAG ...Ramza?
Is that you?
What...what is this place?
"It is so dark, and I...I cannot see."
Am I - what am I doing?
Do I stand?
Sit?
I have no...no sensation.
It's as though I...had no limbs.
RAMZA You are being controlled by Lord Folmarv - a Lucavi!
ZALBAAG Am I...fighting you?
Why...why would I do such a thing?
Ramza...flee.
"Flee, or...or I may strike you down."
RAMZA Lord Brother!
Heed not the false feelings in your mind!
But Zalbaag is unable to stop.
So Ramza does what he must.
"ZALBAAG F-forgive me, Ramza."
I have...have caused you pain.
Alma...Please...
save Alma.
You are her...only hope.
"F-farewell, my brother."

A bluish aura fills the croft.
"LOFFREY We've waited for you, Ramza."
"How very far you've come, but no farther!"
Your bones will rest here in the darkness.
The stones of the monastery make an ironic cairn for a heretic such as you!
After moments of intense fighting.
RAMZA There is something familiar in this.
Something reminiscent of our battle with Celia and Lettie.
You are no mortal man.
"LOFFREY No, that I am not."
I am something far greater.
"Folmarv has made it possible for me to leave behind ignorance, the frailty of the flesh."
I am given the gift of life eternal.
A joy you can never know.
RAMZA What drives you to do what you do?
What is it you seek?
LOFFREY Questions...so many questions.
But your search for answers is in vain.
"They wait beyond me, forever beyond your reach!"

NECROHOL OF MULLONDE - DAY Light returns.
Ramza is transported onto a heraldic glyph inscribed on stone.
Loffrey is wounded and lying against a nearby wall.
RAMZA What is this place?
LOFFREY The necrohol of Mullonde.
Never again will you see the skies of Ivalice.
Without the glyph...the gate...there can be no return.
Loffrey raises his hand and invokes a final incantation.
The stone upon which Ramza arrives collapses into the abyss.
Ramza barely escapes being drawn into the void.
LOFFREY (cont'd) There is...no turning back now.
Go.

The battle rages.
Sword and sorcery collide.
RAMZA Where is Folmarv gone!?
CLETIENNE What manner of question is that?
There is but one place he would go.
Our purpose in coming here is solitary.
"We seek to resurrect our lord and master, the High Seraph."
"Or rather, to awaken him from the imperfect state in which his former host's death has left him."
Lord Folmarv makes for the place our master's soul now dwells - the place where Saint Ajora met his end.
RAMZA Where!?
"CLETIENNE Were I you, I would concern myself with my own fate, not that of Saint Ajora!"
Cletienne perishes just as Loffrey did before him.
CLETIENNE (cont'd) Loffrey...Forgive me...
"Just as he expires, a light flashes in the distance."
RAMZA That flash of light - he must be there!
EXT.

"(MORE)206.I once suffered defeat at your hands,BARICH(cont'd) but it will not happen twice."
This dead city will be your final resting place!
Barich and his unholy minions unleash their attack.
"RAMZA So you've become the pawn of the Lucavi, also."
"Was such your fear of death, that you would sooner bend your knee to demons?"
BARICH You are a naive child who speaks of things he does not understand.
Only now am I made truly human!
RAMZA How does selling your soul to demons make you human?
BARICH I stand above all other men now.
I have transcended death itself!
No longer must I bow my head in coy attempts to curry favor with you highborn nobles!
I've bought my freedom.
I am a human at last - no longer something less!
RAMZA You think freedom a thing bought and sold?
"What value, a freedom you have not earned?"
A man who's lost his pride can never be free.
You surrendered your own freedom the moment you bowed your head to someone undeserving!
Freedom and equality cannot be bartered.
"They are rights - rights earned with sweat, and toil, and blood!"
Freedom is no raiment of Lucavi weave!

"The spirit of the High Seraph lingers in this place, I am sure."
What could be amiss?
ponders( ) Mayhap you are not the vessel of Saint Ajora after all.
No.
"No, it cannot be that."
Virgo stirred at your presence.
You must be the one.
He catches Ramza approaching.
FOLMARV (cont'd) They have come.
"RAMZA It is over, Folmarv!"
You will not rouse Virgo!
End this!
Release my sister!
FOLMARV Of course...It is but a matter of blood!
"You see, do you not?"
She wants for blood.
The Angel of Blood must slake her thirst ere she rise again.
The land has drunk deep of blood in the chiliads since Saint Ajora's death.
Yet still she covets more.
So be it.
"Once more to the world light, there to steep the earth in blood's sweet rain."
Worry not.
You will not live to see the storm.

RAMZA What have you done to her?
"HASHMAL BRINGER OF ORDER Her will intact, our plans come to naught."
"When next she wakes, her sacred task made clear."
Unto this world our brethren must she call.
"And yet again, Ramza emerges trumphant."
HASHMAL BRINGER OF ORDER (cont'd) My lord and master...still you do not wake...
The Virgo Stone sparkles and Alma awakens.
ALMA Wh-where...where am I?
RAMZA Alma!
ALMA Ramza!
Is it...truly you?
HASHMAL BRINGER OF ORDER Too far we've come...to taste now of defeat...Angel...of Blood.
That you should rise...my life I gladly give!
Hashmal pierces himself with his own claws.
"His body disintegrates, leaving only the Libra stone behind."
It shimmers and reacts with the Virgo stone.
Alma screams as she's transformed into the Holy Visage of Saint Ajora.
SAINT AJORA I am come once more.
"RAMZA Alma, no!209.A pillar of light emanates from Saint Ajora."
It seems to struggle with her reincarnation.
SAINT AJORA What...is this?
What happens to me?
Unghhh...Ramza...please.
Help me...
RAMZA Alma!
SAINT AJORA Ramza...No!
You cannot-!
You must not-!
NO!
A blue flame engulfs Ajora and separates Alma from the demon.
She appears relatively unharmed.
RAMZA Alma!
Are you all right?
ALMA I...I will be.
But Ajora - you must kill her...quickly...
SAINT AJORA To thwart my coming...you would dare assay?
No.
It shall not be.
Loyal minions...heed my call - to me!
Ultima demons materialize.
The entire graveyard trembles.
SAINT AJORA (cont'd) I suffer spite...from neither lord...
nor serf!
"A blinding light reveals a transformed Ajora, the High Seraph."
She floats over the battlefield in enchanted crimson dress and white wings.
SAINT AJORA (cont'd) Your defiance reaps you naught but death's embrace!
Ramza and Alma battle the High Seraph.
They narrowly survive just after landing a finishing strike.
"SAINT AJORA (cont'd) Impossible...this end to meet...I see it now, too late."
"In you...his blood, my vanquisher in times...long past."
"But not so soon...shall I accept defeat...210.A rising tempest whisks Saint Ajora away, and a massive blue bolt of light transforms her into the Arch Seraph, ULTIMA, which has a skeletal frame and soulless face."
ARCH SERAPH ULTIMA Your shroud itself shall not escape my wrath!
The final battle ensues.
But Ramza and Alma pull off the impossible and slay Ultima.
ARCH SERAPH ULTIMA (cont'd) Had I but...more power...

May the grace of Saint Ajora lead Alma's soul to the eternal shores of Paradise.
There she shall find peace.

The Priest makes a holy gesture.
Mourners slowly disperse.
MOURNER #1 She was so young.
MOURNER #2 For all the children of the house to be taken at once - the gods are cruel.
"MOURNER #3 And the youngest son, Ramza, denied even a burial - such tragedy."
"MOURNER #4 For three centuries House Beoulve stood, but no more."
"Orran and Valmafra enter as mourners leave.211.ORRAN Ramza, Alma...forgive me."
I am late in paying my respects.
"I would have come sooner, were not so many eyes upon me."
Valmafra lays flowers on the unnamed grave.
ORRAN(cont'd) Delita and Ovelia are wed now.
"A commonborn youth restores peace to the realm, and now together with a princess, he forges a new kingdom."
A tale of heroism not like to be soon forgotten.
"I believe Delita may be just the man you said - pure of heart, in the end."
"When Valmafra revealed herself for an agent of Mullonde, he made it appear as though he'd killed her, then let her run."
I think he must have caught a glimpse of himself in her - a tool manipulated by Lord Folmarv.
Valmafra leaves Orran to his grief.
ORRAN(cont'd) My father...Did...did he die bravely?
I'll visit you again.
Be at peace.
He glances back just as he leaves.
ORRAN(cont'd) Are you truly dead?
I still cannot believe you are gone.
After so much...
"Again as he turns, he sees what appears to be Ramza and Alma in the distance on the backs of chocobos."
ORRAN(cont'd) Could it be-?
The two Beoulve siblings ride off into the woods.

Wait!
Valmafra returns to check on Orran.212.ORRAN(cont'd) They're alive.

A regal Delita dismounts a chocobo and heads for her.
DELITA I thought I might find you here.
Everyone has been looking for you.
He produces a bouquet of flowers.
"DELITA(cont'd) Today's your birthday, is it not?"
"I brought you- Without a moment's notice, Ovelia lunges at Delita with a dagger, stabbing him in the abdomen."
DELITA(cont'd) O-Ovelia?
OVELIA How could you?
"You...you used them, and all the others!"
"And someday you'll cast me aside, just as you did him!"
"Delita dislodges the dagger, then stabs Ovelia, who collapses unconscious."
"He limps away, drops the knife, glancing up at the heavens."
"DELITA Did you get your end in all of this, Ramza?"
I...I got this.
He remains kneeling from a deep wound.
"THE END215.THE SCRIPTURES OF GERMONIQUE (This narration is from Ramza's POV): I opened the Scriptures of Germonique, entrusted to me by Elder Simon, and began to leaf through the pages."
The words before my eyes were writ in a holy script of the ancients.
"Several illustrations were scattered throughout, but many pages were missing or damaged, and the script was exceedingly difficult to decipher."
I was deeply curious as to what knowledge lay within.
"As I was turning pages, faintly penned letters in modern Ivalician script occasionally caught my eye."
Notes of an explanatory nature had been added here and there throughout the book.
I wondered who might have written them.
"Judging by the faded ink, some entries were more than a decade old, while others seemed to have been penned only in the last few days."
"As I touched my finger to one of them, the writing smeared."
The ink had yet to fully dry.
"Every note was written in the same hand -- Elder Simon's, I suddenly realized."
"He must have devoted a significant portion of his life to deciphering these Scriptures, line by painstaking line."
I relied heavily on his fragmentary notes as I continued reading.
"Apparently the holy script had been recorded by Germonique, a disciple of Saint Ajora."
Germonique...That name struck a familiar chord.
Half-forgotten history lessons rose unbidden in my mind.
And then I remembered.
"Germonique was the disciple who had betrayed his master, turning him over to the Holy Ydoran Empire.216.I was astounded that a libram penned by the same Germonique from my history lessons now rested in my very hands."
I could hardly contain myself as I turned the pages.
And then I was assaulted by a shock far greater than the realization that I held a priceless historical artefact.
"Originally I had thought the book to be no more than a collection of Saint Ajora's teaching, as recorded by Germonique."
How unprepared I was to learn what it truly contained.
This tome served as an account of Saint Ajora's life.
The Saint Ajora described within was of a considerably different nature than the man about whom we have all been taught.
I had always known that Saint Ajora was no ordinary mortal.
"My faith in the Church of Glabados was not as profoundly complete as that of my lord brother Zalbaag, yet I did believe that Saint Ajora was a child of the gods, descended from the heavens to deliver humanity from its self-inflicted chaos."
"Or should I say, I had believed."
All I had thought immutable was shattered upon reading the Scriptures.
"Saint Ajora's birth came in the midst of a golden age of technology, when airships yet plied the skies."
"He was born in Lesalia, in the city of Bervenia."
"Moments after his birth, he rose to his feet and approached a well."
"Upon reaching its base, words of prophecy poured forth from his infant lips: ""A calamity shall soon befall this well."
"Seal it up at once, that none may drink of it.""217.Some days later, the Black Death visited the town of Bervenia, and all those who drank the well's tainted water succumbed to the plague and perished."
Only those families who heeded the prophetic words of Saint Ajora were spared from death and malady.
"After the incident with the well, the people came to revere Saint Ajora as a portent of miracle and child of the gods."
"But it was not until he reached the age of twenty that Saint Ajora would become the savior of Ivalice, and take his place among the gods in Paradise."
Ivalice was not always united as it is today.
"Long ago, the realm was divided into seven kingdoms: Fovoham, Lionel, Limberry, Lesalia, Gallionne, Zeltennia, and Mullonde."
Each warred with the others in a never-ending struggle to expand its own territory.
"This conflict had continued for centuries, until an ambitious young king rose to power in Mullonde."
"This young monarch dreamt of united all of Ivalice under his hand, but the road to victory was a difficult and dangerous one."
"The king turned to ancient tomes and the dark magicks found within, summoning a demon from the netherworld to do his bidding."
"But once unleashed, the demon slew the king and set out to destroy the very world itself."
"To combat this monstrosity, a great hero set out on a quest."
"Together with his twelve disciples, he collected the Zodiac Stones that had been scattered throughout the world, and the Zodiac Braves were born again."
"The Zodiac Braves soon defeated the creature's minions and banished the demon back to its infernal plane, for this becoming known as the saviors of our world."
The story is now a well-known legend.
"The Zodiac Braves have since appeared whenever the world balanced on the brink of catastrophe, only to vanish just as quickly once the crisis has been averted.218.Similar catastrophe threatened the world in the time of Saint Ajora."
"The king of Limberry summoned a demon in hopes of seizing control of all of Ivalice, and once again plunged the world into chaos."
"And just as in the legend, Saint Ajora collected the twelve Zodiac Stones."
And once again the Zodiac Braves rose to defeat the marauding demon.
"However, the sovereigns of any age have small tolerance for the interference of well-meaning ""heroes""."
"Fearing the charismatic saint's growing influence, the Holy Ydoran Empire dispatched soldiers to capture him and his devoted followers."
"Pharism was the prevalent religion in that day, and its priests feared Ajora's growing influence."
"Ultimately, Germonique, the thirteenth disciple, was tempted by the sordid coin, offering vital information that led to his master's capture."
The saint was executed upon the gallows of Golgollada soon thereafter.
"But lest we forget, Saint Ajora was a child of the gods."
The wrath of the heavens was swift and terrible.
"Immediately following the execution, Mullonde, the center of Pharist teachings, was visited by a terrible cataclysm and sank into the sea."
Saint Ajora then ascended to Paradise to take his rightful place among the gods.
This was the legend with which I was familiar -- the very same tale told to every child of Ivalice.
But the Saint Ajora described within the Scriptures of Germonique was a different man altogether.
Ajora was no child of the gods.
"He was a mere mortal, no more divine than you or I."
"He was a revolutionary, who fought to realize his own ambitions.219.He was no lover of peace -- no hero who would sacrifice himself for the good of humanity."
"Germonique wrote of him: As the founder of a new religion with a rising number of followers, Ajora was seen as no more than a nuisance to the empire."
But Ajora was apparently more than just a religious founder.
He was a saboteur who infiltrated enemy states to collect information and sow disorder.
"Ajora was a spy, dispatched to the Holy Ydoran Empire by a rival state."
"Whatever he claimed to be, it was fact that the empire began to fear this upstart's growing influence."
Germonique was employed to collect evidence that would allow the empire to arrest Ajora as a spy.
The thirteenth disciple was in reality no more than the empire's instrument in a play to uncover Ajora's true intentions.
It seems that Ajora indeed attempted to reassemble the Zodiac Braves.
Germonique confirmed in his writings that Ajora even discovered some of the Stones.
But what was his purpose in seeking them?
I do not know if the young king of Limberry actually summoned a demon.
"At the very least, I have failed to encounter even a single line within the Scriptures that records the event."
Yet catastrophe did indeed befall Mullonde at the time of Ajora's death.
"According to the Scriptures, the bulk of the city sank into the sea."
The footnotes provided further enlightenment.
"They expressed a different view, no doubt the personal opinion of Elder Simon."
"""Although many spoke of their existence, none had ever set eyes upon these Scriptures of Germonique.220.Some might say they are fraudulent, written with the sole purpose of discrediting Saint Ajora."
"But I know this tome to be authentic."" ""When I served as an inquisitor for the Church, many others in the Holy Office feared the existence of this work."
And the same is no doubt true for the High Confessor.
"They were all fearful of these writings, for everything contained within them is fact."" ""After Saint Ajora's death, the Church, which had capitalized on his considerable influence to seize power for itself, had only one task: to conceal his true nature as a human being."
This one fact had to be erased from the annals of history.
"They needed to ensure that Saint Ajora be remembered as a child of the gods."" ""Their use of the Zodiac Braves, a legend believed throughout Ivalice, was a stroke of genius."
It was a simple feat to convince the people that Saint Ajora had led the Zodiac Braves to defeat a demon.
"A demon that never existed..."" ""I realize now that I had lost my faith the moment I began to read these Scriptures."
And yet I feel no sorrow.
"Thinking back, I now know that my desire to know the truth was stronger than my faith had ever been."" ""But I have committed one great sin."
I failed to condemn the Church for lying to our flock all these years.
And why?
"I knew that if I were to share this book with the world, my precious library would be taken from me."" ""And to me there could be no pain greater, for this library is the only means of slaking my endless thirst for knowledge."
"My curiosity eclipsed my will to do what was right."" Elder Simon wrote that Saint Ajora's demon never existed."
But I have seen the dark power of the Zodiac Stones with my own eyes.221.There is an evil presence at work -- something much more sinister than even the High Confessor and his twisted plots.222.
